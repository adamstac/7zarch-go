# 7zarch Blog Generator: Built and Ready

üéâ **We did it!** The 7zarch blog is now fully operational with our custom static blog generator built in Go.

## What We Built

A **dead-simple, blazing-fast static blog generator** that embodies our philosophy: build simple tools that do one thing exceptionally well.

### Core Features ‚úÖ

- **200-line Go generator** - Clean, readable, maintainable
- **Safe deployment** - Draft/published directory structure prevents accidents
- **Beautiful design** - Terminal-inspired aesthetic with professional typography
- **Syntax highlighting** - Code examples look better than GitHub
- **Zero JavaScript** - Pure HTML/CSS for maximum speed
- **RSS feed** - For the readers who appreciate a good feed
- **Mobile-first** - Works perfectly on all devices

### Technical Highlights

```go
// Command line flexibility for deployment strategy
go run generator.go --source=drafts --output=dev-public    // Development
go run generator.go --source=published --output=public    // Production
```

**Performance**: Builds our entire blog in **~2ms**. That's not a typo.

**Safety**: Impossible to accidentally publish drafts to production.

## The Deployment Strategy

We solved the GitHub Pages deployment problem with a simple but elegant approach:

### Safe Drafting
```bash
# Write freely - never goes live
vim blog/drafts/my-ideas.md
git push  # ‚Üê No deployment triggered
```

### Intentional Publishing
```bash
# Publish when ready
git mv blog/drafts/my-ideas.md blog/published/002-my-ideas.md
git push  # ‚Üê Deployment triggered automatically
```

**Key insight**: Publishing requires **explicit file movement**. No accidents, clear intent, perfect git history.

## Design Philosophy

Our blog reflects our software philosophy:

- **Minimal but powerful** - Every line of CSS has purpose
- **Fast by default** - No JavaScript bloat, optimized typography
- **Developer-focused** - Code blocks extend wider for better readability
- **Honest simplicity** - Clean design that lets content shine

### Typography That Works

- **Massive headers** (3.5rem) with tight letter spacing
- **Generous line height** (1.75) for comfortable reading  
- **Monospace code** with Berkeley Mono ‚Üí JetBrains Mono ‚Üí SF Mono fallback
- **Terminal green accents** (#10b981) for that classic hacker aesthetic

## What's Next

With the blog generator complete, we can now:

1. **Share our story** - Document our AI-augmented development journey
2. **Technical deep dives** - Architecture decisions, performance insights  
3. **Industry commentary** - The future of archive management and developer tools
4. **Community building** - Attract contributors and users who appreciate quality tools

## The Meta-Achievement

**We built a blog generator to blog about building tools.** 

Our first real post will be about Document-Driven Development - the framework that made this rapid development possible. Then we'll dive into our AI agent coordination patterns, the 7EP system, and how we're building the future of archive management.

## Try It Yourself

The complete implementation is in our repo:
