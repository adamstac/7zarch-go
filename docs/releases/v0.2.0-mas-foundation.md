# Release v0.2.0: MAS Foundation

**Release Date:** TBD  
**Type:** Major Feature Release  
**Implements:** 7EP-0004 MAS Foundation Implementation

## üéØ Overview

This release introduces the **MAS (Managed Archive Storage) Foundation** - a complete overhaul of how users interact with archives through intelligent ID resolution, comprehensive archive inspection, and powerful filtering capabilities.

**Key Benefits:**
- **User-Friendly IDs**: Reference archives by short ULID prefixes instead of full paths
- **Intelligent Resolution**: Find archives by ID, name, or checksum with smart disambiguation  
- **Registry Validation**: Verify archive integrity and detect missing/corrupted files
- **Advanced Filtering**: Powerful list command with status, size, time, and profile filters

## ‚ú® New Features

### üîç ULID Resolution System
- **Smart ID Resolution**: Find archives using ULID prefixes as short as 4 characters
- **Multiple Resolution Methods**: Search by ULID, name, or checksum prefix
- **Disambiguation Interface**: Clear options when multiple archives match
- **Performance Optimized**: Sub-50ms resolution for typical use cases

```bash
# Before: Full path required
7zarch-go delete ~/.7zarch-go/archives/project-backup.7z

# After: Short ID reference  
7zarch-go delete 01K2E33    # Uses first 7 characters of ULID
7zarch-go show project      # Or use name
```

### üìã Enhanced Show Command
- **Complete Archive Inspection**: Size, creation date, profile, status, and location
- **File Verification**: Optional checksum validation with `--verify` flag
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual status (‚úì present, ‚ö†Ô∏è missing, ‚ùå corrupted)
- **JSON Output**: Machine-readable format for scripting with `--json`
- **Helpful Suggestions**: Actionable tips based on archive status

```bash
7zarch-go show 01K2E33 --verify
# Archive: project-backup.7z (01K2E33XW4)
# Location: ~/.7zarch-go/archives/project-backup.7z (managed)
# Status: present ‚úì
# Size: 2.1 MB (compressed from 8.7 MB, 75.9% reduction)
# Checksum: sha256:a1b2c3d4... (verified ‚úì)
```

### üóÇÔ∏è Advanced List Filtering
- **Status Filtering**: `--status present|missing|deleted`
- **Location Filtering**: `--managed`, `--external`
- **Profile Filtering**: `--profile media|documents|balanced`
- **Size Filtering**: `--larger-than 100MB`
- **Time Filtering**: `--older-than 7d` (supports d/w/m units)
- **Upload Status**: `--not-uploaded` for cloud workflow
- **Tabular Output**: Organized columns with summary statistics

```bash
# Find large media files not uploaded
7zarch-go list --profile media --larger-than 100MB --not-uploaded

# Show missing archives for troubleshooting
7zarch-go list --status missing --details
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Error Handling
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear explanations with helpful suggestions
- **Standard Error Types**: Consistent error handling across all commands
- **Recovery Guidance**: Specific suggestions for common issues
- **Context-Aware Help**: Error messages include relevant commands

```bash
# Before: "file not found"
# After: "Archive 'project' not found.
#        üí° Use '7zarch-go list' to see available archives"
```

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Database Optimization
- **Indexed Queries**: ULID prefix and name lookups optimized
- **Efficient Filtering**: Database-level filtering for better performance
- **Connection Pooling**: Improved registry access patterns

### Code Organization
- **Standard Error Types**: Consistent error handling with `internal/storage/errors.go`
- **Test Infrastructure**: Builder patterns for reliable testing
- **Documentation Standards**: Comprehensive command reference

## üìö Documentation Updates

### New Documentation
- **[show command reference](../reference/commands/show.md)**: Complete usage guide with examples
- **[list command reference](../reference/commands/list.md)**: All filtering options and use cases
- **[Integration test scenarios](../testing/mas-foundation-integration.md)**: Comprehensive test coverage

### Updated Documentation
- **7EP-0004**: Implementation plan with 90% completion status
- **Command help text**: Improved descriptions and examples
- **Error message guides**: Troubleshooting for common issues

## üöÄ Migration Guide

### Automatic Migration
No action required - existing registries work immediately with new commands.

### New Workflow Patterns

**Before (Path-Based):**
```bash
7zarch-go list
# Find full path in output
7zarch-go delete ~/.7zarch-go/archives/long-archive-name.7z
```

**After (ID-Based):**
```bash
7zarch-go list
# Note short ID in first column
7zarch-go delete 01K2E33  # Much simpler!
```

### Command Enhancements

| Command | Enhancement | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `show` | New ID resolution | `7zarch-go show 01K2E33` |
| `list` | Advanced filtering | `7zarch-go list --profile media --not-uploaded` |
| All | Better error messages | Clear suggestions instead of cryptic errors |

## üß™ Testing

### Validation Coverage
- ‚úÖ ULID resolution across all supported formats
- ‚úÖ Show command file verification and status detection
- ‚úÖ List filtering with complex combinations
- ‚úÖ Error handling with helpful recovery suggestions
- ‚úÖ JSON output format stability for scripting
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarks under target thresholds

### Integration Tests
New comprehensive integration test suite validates:
- End-to-end archive workflow (create ‚Üí show ‚Üí list ‚Üí delete)
- Error scenarios and recovery paths
- Performance with large registry datasets
- Cross-platform compatibility

## ‚ö° Performance

### Benchmarks
- **ID Resolution**: <50ms for any query type
- **Show Command**: <100ms including file verification  
- **List Operations**: <200ms for 1000+ archives with filters
- **Memory Usage**: <10MB for typical registry operations

### Optimization Notes
- Database indexes added for common query patterns
- ULID prefix matching optimized for user typing patterns
- Lazy loading for expensive operations (checksum verification)

**None** - This is a purely additive release. All existing commands and workflows continue unchanged.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed command registration to make MAS commands accessible
- Improved configuration integration for retention policies
- Enhanced database schema migration handling
- Resolved edge cases in ULID generation and collision handling

## üë• Contributors
