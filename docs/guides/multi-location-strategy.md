# Multi-Location Archive Strategy

*This guide outlines the future vision for managing archives across multiple storage locations with 7zarch-go.*

## Overview

7zarch-go's registry-based architecture enables tracking archives regardless of where they're stored - local managed storage, custom directories, network storage, or cloud providers. This creates powerful workflows for organizing digital assets across their entire lifecycle.

## The Universal Registry Concept

### Storage Location as Metadata
```bash
# All archives tracked in unified registry regardless of location:
7zarch-go create project1                        # â†’ managed storage
7zarch-go create project2 --output ~/backups/    # â†’ custom local path
7zarch-go create project3 --output /nas/vol/     # â†’ network storage

# Manage uniformly by ID, not location:
7zarch-go list                    # Shows ALL archives
7zarch-go show 01JEX             # Works anywhere
7zarch-go move a1b2c --to managed # Location-agnostic operations
```

### Benefits
- **Unified management**: One interface for all archives
- **Location flexibility**: Store where it makes sense
- **Easy migration**: Move between locations without losing tracking
- **Universal search**: Find archives regardless of storage

## Strategic Workflows

### Content-Aware Storage Placement

**Large Media Files** â†’ High-capacity network storage
```bash
7zarch-go create video-project --profile media --output /nas/media/
```

**Code and Documents** â†’ Cloud backup with local copies
```bash
7zarch-go create ~/Code/project --profile documents --comprehensive
```

**Temporary Archives** â†’ Local storage with auto-cleanup
```bash
7zarch-go create temp-data --output /tmp/archives/
```

### Intelligent Archive Lifecycle

#### Stage 1: Active Development
- Keep working archives in managed local storage
- Fast access, frequent modifications
- Regular integrity testing

#### Stage 2: Project Completion  
- Move to network storage for team access
- Maintain comprehensive metadata
- Periodic verification

#### Stage 3: Long-term Archival
- Transfer to cost-effective cloud storage
- Infrequent access, maximum durability
- Audit trail maintenance

### Multi-Location Backup Strategy

#### Redundancy Approach
```bash
# Important projects: multiple location copies
7zarch-go create critical-project --comprehensive
7zarch-go copy 01JEX --to /nas/backups/
7zarch-go copy 01JEX --to cloud://bucket/archives/
```

#### Geographic Distribution
- **Local**: Fast access, working copies
- **Network**: Team sharing, intermediate backup
- **Cloud**: Disaster recovery, long-term retention

## Future Capabilities

### Automated Tiering
```bash
# Intelligent storage optimization
7zarch-go tier --frequently-accessed --to local
7zarch-go tier --older-than 6m --to network
7zarch-go tier --older-than 2y --to cold-storage
```

### Cross-Location Operations
```bash
# Universal discovery
7zarch-go search "kubernetes" --all-locations
7zarch-go list --on network --larger-than 1GB

# Seamless movement
7zarch-go move --pattern "backup-*" --to cloud
7zarch-go replicate --important --to 2-locations
```

### Cost Optimization
```bash
# Storage cost management
7zarch-go costs --breakdown by-location
7zarch-go optimize --budget $100/month --suggest-moves
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- âœ… ULID-based tracking system
- âœ… Registry for managed and external archives
- ðŸ”„ Location-agnostic operations (show, move, delete)

### Phase 2: Multi-Location Support
- ðŸ”„ Network path support (`/nas/`, `//server/share`)
- ðŸ”„ Location-aware listing and filtering
- ðŸ”„ Cross-location move operations

### Phase 3: Cloud Integration
- ðŸ”„ Cloud storage backends (S3, Azure, GCS)
- ðŸ”„ Automated tiering policies
- ðŸ”„ Cost optimization tools

### Phase 4: Advanced Management
- ðŸ”„ Multi-device registry sync
- ðŸ”„ Content-based deduplication
- ðŸ”„ Automated lifecycle policies

## Configuration Strategy

### Storage Preferences
```yaml
storage:
  locations:
    managed: ~/.7zarch-go/archives/
    network: /nas/archives/
    cloud: s3://my-bucket/archives/
  
  policies:
    default_location: managed
    large_files: network      # > 1GB
    important: multi_location # redundant storage
    temporary: local_only     # auto-cleanup
```

### Workflow Rules
```yaml
workflows:
  podcast:
    create_location: managed
    archive_to: network
    retention: 2_years
    
  development:
    create_location: managed
    backup_to: cloud
    archive_after: 6_months
```

## Best Practices

### Location Strategy
- **Local managed**: Active projects, frequent access
- **Network storage**: Team collaboration, intermediate capacity  
- **Cloud storage**: Long-term retention, disaster recovery

### Naming Conventions
- Include location hints: `project-name-location.7z`
- Date-based organization: `YYYY-MM-DD-project.7z`
- Purpose indicators: `backup-`, `archive-`, `temp-`

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- Regular integrity checks across all locations
- Automated redundancy verification
- Storage cost monitoring and optimization
- Lifecycle policy enforcement
