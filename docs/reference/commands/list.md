## Filtering Examples

### Basic Filters

**Show only managed archives:**
```bash
7zarch-go list --managed
```

**Show archives not yet uploaded:**
```bash
7zarch-go list --not-uploaded
```

**Show missing archives:**
```bash
7zarch-go list --missing
```

### Pattern Matching

**Filter by name pattern:**
```bash
7zarch-go list --pattern "project-*"
7zarch-go list --pattern "*.backup.7z"
```

### Time-Based Filters

**Show archives older than 7 days:**
```bash
7zarch-go list --older-than 7d     # 7 days
7zarch-go list --older-than 2w     # 2 weeks
7zarch-go list --older-than 720h   # 720 hours (30 days)
```

### Size-Based Filters

**Show large archives:**
```bash
7zarch-go list --larger-than 100MB
7zarch-go list --larger-than 1GB
```

### Status and Profile Filters

**Filter by status:**
```bash
7zarch-go list --status present    # Active archives
7zarch-go list --status deleted    # In trash
7zarch-go list --status missing    # File not found
```

**Filter by compression profile:**
```bash
7zarch-go list --profile media      # Media-optimized archives
7zarch-go list --profile documents  # Document-optimized archives
```

### Combined Filters

**Complex queries:**
```bash
# Large media files not uploaded
7zarch-go list --profile media --larger-than 100MB --not-uploaded

# Old external archives
7zarch-go list --external --older-than 30d

# Missing managed archives
7zarch-go list --managed --status missing
```

## Directory Listing

List .7z files in a specific directory (bypasses registry):
```bash
7zarch-go list --directory ~/Backups/
```

Output:
```
üìÅ Listing .7z files in: ~/Backups/

Found 3 archive(s):

üì¶ backup-2025-08-01.7z
üì¶ backup-2025-08-08.7z
üì¶ backup-2025-08-15.7z
```

With details:
```bash
7zarch-go list --directory ~/Backups/ --details
```

## Status Indicators

- `‚úì` - Archive present and accessible
- `‚ö†Ô∏è` - Archive missing from expected location
- `üì§` - Not uploaded to remote storage
- `‚úÖ` - Uploaded to remote storage
- `üóëÔ∏è` - Deleted (in trash)

## Empty State

When no archives match the filters:
```
No archives found.
üí° Tip: Create archives with '7zarch-go create <path>' to see them here.
```

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success - archives listed |
| 1 | Registry access error |
| 2 | Invalid filter parameters |
| 3 | Directory not found (with --directory) |

## Configuration

The `list` command respects these configuration settings:

```yaml
ui:
  default_list_limit: 50    # Pagination limit
  show_full_uid: false      # Show first 10 chars by default
  
storage:
  retention_days: 30        # For auto-purge display
```

## Use Cases

### Daily Status Check
```bash
# Morning archive status
7zarch-go list --not-uploaded       # What needs uploading?
7zarch-go list --missing            # Any files disappeared?
7zarch-go list --older-than 30d     # What can be cleaned up?
```

### Storage Management
```bash
# Find space-consuming archives
7zarch-go list --larger-than 1GB --details

# Identify cleanup candidates
7zarch-go list --older-than 90d --external
```

### Upload Workflow
```bash
# List archives ready for upload
7zarch-go list --not-uploaded --managed

# After upload, verify
7zarch-go list --pattern "uploaded-*"
```

### Troubleshooting
```bash
# Find problematic archives
7zarch-go list --status missing --details

# Check specific profile performance
7zarch-go list --profile media --details
```

## Tips

### Performance
- Filters are applied sequentially for optimal performance
- Use specific filters to reduce result sets
- Pattern matching uses glob syntax (faster than regex)

### Organization
- The tabular format aligns columns for easy scanning
- Archives are grouped by status and location
- Deleted archives show auto-purge countdown

### Scripting
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Find large archives not uploaded
for id in $(7zarch-go list --larger-than 1GB --not-uploaded --format ids); do
    echo "Processing $id"
    7zarch-go show "$id"
done
```
