# 7EP-0002: CI Integration & Automation

**Status:** Implemented  
**Author(s):** Claude Code (CC)  
**Assignment:** CC  
**Difficulty:** 2 (easy - existing tooling integration)  
**Created:** 2025-08-12  
**Updated:** 2025-08-12  
**Implementation:** 2025-08-12  

## Executive Summary

Implement GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing, building, and quality checks to ensure code reliability and maintainable development practices across parallel CC/AC development.

## Evidence & Reasoning

**User feedback/pain points:**
- Manual testing burden on user during development iterations
- Need for consistent quality checks before merging changes
- Parallel development requires automated verification to prevent conflicts

**Current limitations:**
- No automated testing on pull requests or pushes
- Manual build verification process
- Inconsistent code quality checks
- No automated release process

**Why now:**
- Project has mature Makefile with comprehensive targets
- Parallel development model (CC/AC) needs automated coordination
- User testing revealed importance of consistent builds
- Foundation exists for easy CI integration

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Case: Automated PR Verification
```yaml
# On every pull request:
- Run tests across multiple Go versions
- Verify builds work on different platforms  
- Check code formatting and linting
- Validate no regressions in core functionality
```

### Secondary Use Cases
- **Push protection**: Prevent broken code from reaching main branch
- **Release automation**: Automated binary builds for releases
- **Dependency monitoring**: Alert on security vulnerabilities
- **Performance tracking**: Monitor build times and test coverage

## Technical Design

### Overview
Leverage existing Makefile targets in GitHub Actions workflows for comprehensive CI coverage without duplicating build logic.

### Workflow Components

#### Core Testing Workflow (`test.yml`)
```yaml
name: Test
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]
        go-version: [1.21, 1.22, 1.23]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
      - run: make test
      - run: make test-integration
```

#### Quality Checks Workflow (`quality.yml`)
```yaml  
name: Quality
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  quality:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
      - run: make lint
      - run: make vet
      - run: make fmt-check
```

#### Build Verification (`build.yml`)
```yaml
name: Build
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4  
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
      - run: make build
      - run: make build-all
```

### API Changes
No API changes - purely infrastructure enhancement.

### Data Model Changes
None - leverages existing project structure.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core CI Pipeline
- [x] Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` for automated testing
- [x] Create `.github/workflows/quality.yml` for linting and formatting  
- [x] Create `.github/workflows/build.yml` for build verification
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules requiring CI checks (requires admin access)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Automation
- [x] Add release workflow for automated binary builds
- [x] Implement dependency vulnerability scanning (via Dependabot)
- [x] Add security scanning with Gosec
- [x] Configure Dependabot for automated dependency updates

### Dependencies
- Existing Makefile with comprehensive targets (implemented)
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Go toolchain compatibility across versions

## Testing Strategy

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All tests pass on Ubuntu and macOS with Go 1.21 and 1.22
- [ ] Builds succeed on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- [ ] Code formatting and linting checks pass
- [ ] PRs cannot be merged without passing CI
- [ ] Failed CI provides clear, actionable error messages
- [ ] CI completes within reasonable time (< 10 minutes)

### Test Scenarios  
- Cross-platform compatibility verification
- Multiple Go version support
- Integration test reliability
- Build artifact validation
- Lint rule enforcement

## Migration/Compatibility

### Breaking Changes
None - additive CI infrastructure only.

### Upgrade Path
No migration required - workflows activate automatically.

### Backward Compatibility
Fully compatible - existing development workflow unchanged.

## Alternatives Considered

**Travis CI or CircleCI**: Considered external CI providers but GitHub Actions provides better integration, free tier, and simpler configuration.

**Docker-based testing**: Evaluated containerized testing but decided direct runner execution is simpler and faster for this Go project.

**Custom test runners**: Considered building custom CI but existing Makefile targets provide all needed functionality.

## Future Considerations

- **Multi-arch builds**: ARM64 builds for Apple Silicon and ARM servers
- **Security scanning**: Integration with GitHub's security advisory database
- **Performance benchmarking**: Automated performance regression detection
- **Documentation automation**: Auto-generate docs from code changes
- **Release automation**: Semantic versioning and automated releases

## Implementation Notes

### What Was Implemented (2025-08-12)

**Core Workflows Created:**
1. **test.yml** - Comprehensive test suite running on Ubuntu and macOS with Go 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23
   - Unit tests, integration tests, MAS tests, edge case tests
   - Race condition detection
   - Code coverage reporting with artifact upload

2. **quality.yml** - Code quality and security checks
   - Go vet and formatting verification
   - GolangCI-Lint integration for comprehensive linting
   - Gosec security scanner with SARIF upload for GitHub Security tab

3. **build.yml** - Multi-platform build verification
   - Native builds on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows
   - Cross-compilation verification for all target platforms
   - Binary artifact upload for PR testing

4. **release.yml** - Automated release process
   - Triggered on version tags (v*)
   - Multi-platform binary builds with checksums
   - Automatic changelog generation from commits
   - Docker image build and push to GitHub Container Registry
   - Support for pre-release versions (rc, beta, alpha)

**Additional Configurations:**
- **Dockerfile** - Multi-stage build for minimal container images
- **dependabot.yml** - Automated dependency updates for Go modules and GitHub Actions

### Key Decisions

1. **Go Version Matrix**: Testing against Go 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23 ensures compatibility across recent versions
2. **Security First**: Integrated Gosec scanner and Dependabot from the start
3. **Docker Support**: Added containerization for cloud-native deployments
4. **Artifact Retention**: 7-day retention for test artifacts balances storage with debugging needs

### Next Steps

- Branch protection rules need to be configured by repository admin
- Monitor CI performance and adjust timeout/concurrency as needed
- Consider adding benchmarking workflow once performance tests mature
