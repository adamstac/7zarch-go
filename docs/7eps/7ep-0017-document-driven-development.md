# 7EP-0017: Document Driven Development Framework

**Status:** Draft  
**Author(s):** Amp (Sourcegraph), Adam Stacoviak  
**Assignment:** Framework Design  
**Difficulty:** 3 (moderate - process standardization with systematic coordination)  
**Created:** 2025-08-13  
**Updated:** 2025-08-13  

## Executive Summary

Establish a systematic Document Driven Development (DDD) framework that separates "what to build" (7EPs), "who builds it" (team identity docs), and "current priorities" (team assignment docs + shared NEXT.md), creating clear coordination patterns that scale from individual tasks to cross-team sprints.

## Evidence & Reasoning

**Current Documentation Success:**
- ‚úÖ **7EP system** working excellently for feature specification and technical design
- ‚úÖ **Team identity docs** (AMP.md, CLAUDE.md, AUGMENT.md, ADAM.md) provide role clarity
- ‚úÖ **Recent coordination success** - 7EP-0014 foundation sprint (2 days vs 4-6 target)
- ‚úÖ **Cross-team collaboration** - Amp TUI + CC backend integration working well

**Coordination Gaps Identified:**
- **Priority confusion** - No clear "what's next for everyone" visibility
- **Assignment ambiguity** - 7EPs have assignments but no current task tracking
- **Handoff friction** - Success patterns exist but not systematized
- **Cross-dependencies** - Limited visibility into blocking relationships

**Strategic Need:**
- **Scale coordination** - Framework that works for 2-10 team members
- **Maintain momentum** - Clear priorities prevent idle time and duplicate work
- **Document everything** - All decisions and priorities captured in git-tracked docs
- **Enable autonomy** - Team members can see their priorities and dependencies clearly

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Case: Clear Priority Coordination
```bash
# Team member wants to know what to work on
1. Check personal assignment doc: docs/development/CLAUDE.md
2. Check shared priorities: docs/development/NEXT.md  
3. Check active 7EP coordination: docs/7eps/7ep-XXXX.md

# Result: Clear understanding of current work + next priorities + coordination needs
```

### Secondary Use Cases

#### Cross-Team Sprint Coordination
```markdown
# Example: 7EP-0014 Foundation Sprint pattern
docs/7eps/7ep-0014.md:
- Phase assignments with clear deliverables
- Success metrics and timeline
- Coordination points between team members

docs/development/NEXT.md:
- Sprint status: "Phase 2 active, Phase 3 waiting"
- Blockers: "PR #11 CI fixes needed before Phase 2 completion"
- Next actions: "CC: Fix CI, Amp: Review Phase 2 when complete"
```

#### Individual Task Management  
```markdown
# Example: CC current work clarity
docs/development/CLAUDE.md:
## Current Assignments (Updated: 2025-08-13)
- **7EP-0007 Phase 3** - ACTIVE (implementing batch operations, ETA: 3-4 days)
- **Performance review** - BLOCKED (waiting for Amp architectural feedback)
- **Code review queue** - READY (2 PRs need review)

## Next Priorities
1. Complete 7EP-0007 Phase 3 batch operations
2. Hand off to Amp for architectural review  
3. Begin TrueNAS backend integration (7EP-0018)
```

## Technical Design

### Document Architecture

#### **Layer 1: Identity & Roles** (Root Level)
```
/AMP.md           # Amp capabilities and activation protocols
/CLAUDE.md        # CC role definition and context  
/AUGMENT.md       # AC role definition and context
/ADAM.md          # Project owner perspective and priorities
```

**Purpose:** Who are the team members, what are their capabilities, how to activate specific roles

#### **Layer 2: Specifications** (docs/7eps/)
```
/docs/7eps/7ep-XXXX.md    # Feature specifications (WHAT to build)
/docs/7eps/index.md       # Status tracking and overview
/docs/7eps/template.md    # Standardized 7EP format
```

**Purpose:** Long-term planning, technical specifications, no current assignments

#### **Layer 3: Current Work** (docs/development/)
```
/docs/development/AMP.md      # Amp current assignments and priorities
/docs/development/CLAUDE.md   # CC current work and next tasks
/docs/development/AUGMENT.md  # AC current assignments and coordination
/docs/development/ADAM.md     # Project owner current focus and decisions
/docs/development/NEXT.md     # Shared coordination hub for everyone
```

**Purpose:** Current task tracking, priority coordination, immediate planning

#### **Layer 4: Process Documentation** (docs/development/)
```
/docs/development/handoff-protocols.md
/docs/development/coordination-patterns.md
/docs/development/documentation-standards.md
```

**Purpose:** How coordination works, standardized patterns, process guidance

## Migration/Compatibility

### Breaking Changes
None - framework enhances existing documentation, doesn't replace it.

### Upgrade Path
- Create team assignment docs in docs/development/ for existing team members
- Populate NEXT.md with current project priorities
- Enhance active 7EPs with coordination sections
- Gradually adopt framework patterns for new work

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing 7EPs continue working unchanged
- Team identity docs (AMP.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.) remain as role definitions
- Existing coordination patterns continue while new framework adds structure

## Implementation Examples

```markdown
# Amp Current Assignments

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-13 15:30
