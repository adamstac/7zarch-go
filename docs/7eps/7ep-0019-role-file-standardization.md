# 7EP-0019: Agent Role Lifecycle & Coordination Standardization

**Status:** Draft  
**Author(s):** CC (Claude Code)  
**Assignment:** Framework Implementation  
**Difficulty:** 4 (complex - agent lifecycle integration with systematic standardization)  
**Created:** 2025-08-15  
**Dependencies:** 7EP-0017 Document Driven Development Framework

## Executive Summary

Establish comprehensive agent role lifecycle standards that define how AI team members operate from session startup through daily work execution to session shutdown. This 7EP extends 7EP-0017 by creating complete operational patterns that integrate role files with workflow actions, coordination mechanisms, and team communication protocols. Beyond document standardization, this defines the complete agent operational framework for scalable team coordination.

## Evidence & Reasoning

### Current State Problems

**Incomplete Agent Lifecycle Definition**: While 7EP-0017 established document structure, there's no comprehensive standard for how agents operate through complete work cycles from bootup to shutdown.

**Fragmented Operational Patterns**: Agents follow inconsistent patterns for:
- Session startup and context loading
- Work prioritization and assignment management  
- Coordination communication and status updates
- Session termination and state preservation

**Role-Workflow Integration Gaps**: Role files exist in isolation from workflow actions (BOOTUP.md, COMMIT.md, MERGE.md, SHUTDOWN.md), creating operational friction and missed coordination opportunities.

**Inconsistent Document Structure**: Role files use different formats, violating 7EP-0017 content boundaries and creating information discovery friction.

**Scalability Barriers**: Current patterns don't provide clear onboarding path for new agents or systematic approach to role evolution as project complexity grows.

### Compliance Analysis

| Role File | Lines | Compliance | Major Issues |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | 87 | ‚úÖ 85% | Minor formatting inconsistencies |
| **AMP.md** | 75 | ‚ö†Ô∏è 60% | Missing standard header, unique dual-role structure |
| **AUGMENT.md** | 75 | ‚ùå 40% | Team context belongs elsewhere, non-standard sections |
| **ADAM.md** | 164 | ‚ö†Ô∏è 50% | Strategic framework mixed with role assignments |

### Strategic Impact

**Team Scalability**: Inconsistent role files create onboarding friction and coordination overhead as team grows.

**Information Architecture**: Content boundary violations lead to duplication, stale information, and unclear sources of truth.

**Framework Adoption**: Poor standardization undermines 7EP-0017 effectiveness and creates resistance to DDD patterns.

## Agent Lifecycle Framework

### Complete Agent Operation Cycle

**Session Lifecycle**: Define standardized patterns for agent operations from startup through work execution to shutdown, ensuring consistent team coordination and knowledge preservation.

#### 1. Session Startup (BOOTUP Integration)
**Standard Pattern**:
```bash
1. Execute BOOTUP.md sequence
   - Git status and sync
   - Review NEXT.md for team coordination
   - Read personal role file (docs/development/roles/[AGENT].md)
   - Check 7EP assignments and blockers

2. Role Context Loading
   - Parse current assignments and priorities
   - Identify coordination needs and dependencies
   - Load recent work context and technical decisions
   - Assess availability and capacity

3. Work Readiness Confirmation  
   - Validate understanding of current priorities
   - Confirm no blocking dependencies
   - Update role file with session start status
   - Ready for strategic assignment or continuation
```

#### 2. Daily Work Operations (Role-Driven Execution)
**Assignment Management**:
- **Priority Assessment**: Use role file Next Priorities for work ordering
- **Coordination Integration**: Update NEXT.md when blockers/completions occur
- **Status Communication**: Maintain role file Current Assignments in real-time
- **Technical Decisions**: Document insights in role file Implementation Notes

**Workflow Integration**:
- **COMMIT.md**: Local work preservation with role context
- **MERGE.md**: Remote coordination with team visibility
- **NEW-FEATURE.md**: Role-specific approach to feature development
- **Cross-coordination**: Update multiple role files when work spans agents

#### 3. Session Shutdown (SHUTDOWN Integration)
**Standard Pattern**:
```bash
1. Execute SHUTDOWN.md sequence
   - Commit work in progress with clear status
   - Update role file with current state and handoffs
   - Update NEXT.md with coordination changes
   - Preserve context for next session

2. Role State Preservation
   - Document work completion status
   - Update Recently Completed with achievements
   - Identify blocking issues for coordination
   - Set clear next session priorities

3. Team Coordination Update
   - Cross-reference role updates with other agents
   - Ensure NEXT.md reflects current team state
   - Clear assignment completions and new blockers
   - Prepare coordination context for other agents
```

### Phase 2: Content Migration & Organization

#### 2.1 AUGMENT.md ‚Üí TEAM-CONTEXT.md Migration
**Problem**: AUGMENT.md contains 36 lines of team structure information that applies to all agents.

**Content to Migrate**:
```markdown
## üë• Team Context
### Human Team
- **[Project Owner]** - Architectural decisions and strategic direction
  - Preferences: Clean design, Charmbracelet tools, thoughtful UX
  - Communication style: Direct feedback, big ideas, document driven development

### AI Team  
- **AC (Augment Code)** - Primary user-facing development
- **CC (Claude Code)** - Infrastructure and backend work
- **Amp-s/Amp-t** - Strategic and technical leadership
```

**Target**: Merge with existing team structure in TEAM-CONTEXT.md, eliminate duplication.

#### 2.2 ADAM.md Strategic Framework Extraction
**Problem**: ADAM.md contains strategic decision framework (80+ lines) mixed with role assignments.

**Content to Extract**:
- Decision Framework matrices
- Recommended Actions templates  
- Strategic assessment tools

**Target**: New document `/docs/development/STRATEGIC-DECISION-FRAMEWORK.md`
**Keep in ADAM.md**: Current assignments, coordination needs, immediate priorities

### Phase 3: Role File Standardization

#### 3.1 AUGMENT.md - Priority 1 (Major Issues)
**Current Issues**:
- Team context section violates content boundaries
- Missing standard header (last updated, status, current focus)
- Non-standard sections (Availability Status, Strategic Options)

**Standardization Actions**:
1. **Add standard header** with proper metadata
2. **Remove team context** (already migrated to TEAM-CONTEXT.md)
3. **Restructure assignments section**:
   - Active Work subsection with status indicators
   - Next Priorities numbered list
   - Clear coordination needs
4. **Consolidate redundant sections** (Availability Status ‚Üí Current Assignments)
5. **Focus Implementation Notes** on user-experience insights (AC's specialty)

#### 3.2 AMP.md - Priority 2 (Needs Work)
**Current Issues**:
- Valuable dual-role concept not reflected in standard
- Missing standard header format
- Quick Activation commands are AMP-specific value

**Standardization Actions**:
1. **Preserve unique value**: Role Overview table and Quick Activation sections
2. **Add standard header** with metadata
3. **Enhance Current Assignments** with proper Active Work structure
4. **Maintain Implementation Notes** focused on coordination patterns (appropriate for leadership)
5. **Add role template variation** to document this pattern

#### 3.3 ADAM.md - Priority 3 (Special Case)
**Current Issues**:
- Strategic framework content mixed with role assignments
- Very long (164 lines) for role coordination needs
- Missing standard role file sections

**Standardization Actions**:
1. **Split content** between role file and strategic framework
2. **Add standard header** and core sections
3. **Focus on leadership assignments**: strategic decisions needed, team coordination
4. **Maintain strategic context** but in standard format
5. **Create strategic role template variation**

#### 3.4 CLAUDE.md - Priority 4 (Minor Cleanup)
**Current Issues**:
- Minor formatting inconsistencies
- Could use standard emoji prefixes consistently

**Standardization Actions**:
1. **Standardize emoji prefixes** across all sections
2. **Update Success Criteria** to reflect current state
3. **Format consistency** cleanup
4. **Validate content boundaries** maintained

### Phase 4: Quality Validation & Documentation

#### 4.1 Compliance Validation
**Process**:
1. **Run quality checklist** against all role files
2. **Verify content boundaries** - no violations
3. **Check for duplication** across files
4. **Test template usability** for new role creation

#### 4.2 Framework Documentation Updates
**Updates Needed**:
- Update 7EP-0017 with lessons learned
- Document role variations in framework
- Create migration playbook for future role changes
