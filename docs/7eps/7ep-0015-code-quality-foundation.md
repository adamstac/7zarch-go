# 7EP-0015: Code Quality Foundation

**Status:** Draft  
**Author(s):** Claude Code (CC)  
**Assignment:** CC  
**Difficulty:** 2 (straightforward - improvements to existing code)  
**Created:** 2025-08-13  
**Updated:** 2025-08-13

## Executive Summary

Establish comprehensive code quality, documentation, and performance baseline improvements across the 7zarch-go codebase while Amp completes 7EP-0014 foundation work. Focus on non-architectural changes that improve maintainability, user experience, and development velocity without conflicting with future strategic direction.

## Evidence & Reasoning

**Current opportunity:**
- Amp is executing 7EP-0014 Critical Foundation Gaps with exceptional results (2/3 phases complete, ahead of schedule)
- CC bandwidth available while waiting for Amp's strategic direction on 7EP-0007
- Solid foundation work creates opportunity for quality improvements on stable base
- Non-conflicting improvements can be made without affecting architectural decisions

**User feedback/pain points:**
- Inconsistent error messages across different commands reduce user confidence
- Help text varies in quality and completeness between commands
- No performance baselines established for optimization decisions
- Documentation gaps in user guides and API references
- Code complexity in some areas affects maintainability

**Strategic timing:**
- Perfect window between foundation completion (7EP-0014) and next major feature (7EP-0007)
- Quality improvements on solid foundation are more valuable than on unstable base
- Establishes clean codebase for future feature development
- Supports Amp's strategic analysis by providing performance baselines

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Case: Developer Experience Improvement
```bash
# Consistent error patterns across all commands
7zarch-go show invalid-id
# Error: Archive 'invalid-id' not found. Use 'list' to see available archives.

7zarch-go delete invalid-id  
# Error: Archive 'invalid-id' not found. Use 'list' to see available archives.

# Improved help text consistency
7zarch-go help list
# Comprehensive examples and flag explanations

# Performance visibility
7zarch-go --debug list
# Shows query timing and performance metrics
```

### Secondary Use Cases
- **Maintainability**: Future developers can understand and modify code easily
- **User Confidence**: Consistent, helpful error messages and documentation
- **Performance Awareness**: Baseline metrics for optimization decisions
- **Quality Gates**: Higher test coverage catches regressions early

## Technical Design

### Overview
Implement systematic code quality improvements across five key areas: error handling consistency, documentation completeness, performance visibility, code maintainability, and test coverage enhancement.

### Component 1: Error Handling Standardization

**Consistent Error Patterns:**
```go
// Standard error types with consistent messaging
type ValidationError struct {
    Field   string
    Value   string
    Message string
}

func (e *ValidationError) Error() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("Invalid %s '%s': %s", e.Field, e.Value, e.Message)
}

// Standardized resolution suggestions
type ResolutionError struct {
    ID          string
    Suggestions []string
}

func (e *ResolutionError) Error() string {
    base := fmt.Sprintf("Archive '%s' not found.", e.ID)
    if len(e.Suggestions) > 0 {
        base += fmt.Sprintf(" Try: %s", strings.Join(e.Suggestions, ", "))
    }
    return base
}
```

**Consistent Error Messages:**
- Archive not found: Standard format with helpful suggestions
- Invalid flags: Clear explanation of valid options
- Permission errors: Actionable resolution steps
- Database errors: User-friendly explanations with recovery options

### Component 2: Documentation Enhancement

**Help Text Improvements:**
```bash
# Enhanced command help with examples
7zarch-go help list
# Usage: 7zarch-go list [flags]
# 
# List archives in the registry with various display and filtering options.
#
# Examples:
#   7zarch-go list                    # All archives, auto-detect display
#   7zarch-go list --table            # Table format
#   7zarch-go list --missing          # Only missing archives  
#   7zarch-go list --larger-than 100M # Archives larger than 100MB
#
# Flags:
#   --table          Use table display mode
#   --missing        Show only missing archives
#   --larger-than    Filter by minimum size (e.g., 100M, 1G)
```

**User Guide Improvements:**
- Getting started guide with common workflows
- Command reference with comprehensive examples
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Integration examples for scripting and automation

### Component 3: Performance Baseline System

**Debug Performance Output:**
```go
type PerformanceMetrics struct {
    QueryTime     time.Duration
    ResultCount   int
    DatabaseSize  int64
    MemoryUsage   uint64
}

func (pm *PerformanceMetrics) String() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("Query: %v, Results: %d, DB: %s, Memory: %s",
        pm.QueryTime, pm.ResultCount, 
        humanize.Bytes(uint64(pm.DatabaseSize)),
        humanize.Bytes(pm.MemoryUsage))
}
```

**Performance Flags:**
```bash
# Add --debug flag to major commands
7zarch-go list --debug
# Output includes: Query: 2.3ms, Results: 157, DB: 2.4MB, Memory: 8.1MB

7zarch-go show <id> --debug  
# Shows resolution time, file stat time, display rendering time
```

### Component 4: Code Quality Improvements

**Refactoring Priorities:**
```go
// Extract common patterns into reusable functions
func handleResolutionError(err error, cmd string) error {
    if amb, ok := err.(*storage.AmbiguousIDError); ok {
        printAmbiguousOptions(amb)
        return fmt.Errorf("use longer prefix or full UID")
    }
    if _, ok := err.(*storage.NotFoundError); ok {
        return fmt.Errorf("archive not found. Use '%s list' to see available archives", cmd)
    }
    return err
}

// Consistent flag handling patterns
func addCommonFlags(cmd *cobra.Command) {
    cmd.Flags().Bool("debug", false, "Show performance and debug information")
    cmd.Flags().String("output", "table", "Output format (table|json|csv|yaml)")
}
```

**Code Organization:**
- Extract common CLI patterns into shared utilities
- Standardize command structure and flag handling
- Improve function and variable naming consistency
- Add strategic comments for complex business logic only

### Component 5: Test Coverage Enhancement

**Coverage Analysis:**
```bash
# Identify coverage gaps
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html

# Focus areas for additional tests:
# - Error handling paths
# - Edge cases in ULID resolution  
# - Display mode boundary conditions
# - Archive validation logic
```

**Test Categories:**
- **Unit Tests**: Core business logic, validation functions
- **Integration Tests**: Command execution, database operations
- **Error Path Tests**: All error conditions and recovery
- **Performance Tests**: Baseline performance validation
