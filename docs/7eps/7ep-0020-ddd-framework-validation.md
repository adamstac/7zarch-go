# 7EP-0020: DDD Framework Validation & Compliance Suite

**Status:** Complete  
**Author(s):** Amp-s (Strategic)  
**Assignment:** Framework Validation  
**Difficulty:** 5 (complex - comprehensive validation system with CI integration)  
**Created:** 2025-08-15  
**Dependencies:** 7EP-0017 Document Driven Development Framework, 7EP-0019 Agent Lifecycle Framework

## Executive Summary

Establish comprehensive validation and compliance testing for the complete Document Driven Development (DDD) framework, ensuring systematic verification of document structure, cross-file consistency, workflow integration, git pattern compliance, and complete agent lifecycle functionality. This transforms the DDD framework from "operational" to "systematically validated and CI-enforced," providing confidence in framework reliability and enabling safe team scaling.

## Evidence & Reasoning

### Current Validation State

**Limited Coverage**: Current `validate-roles.sh` provides basic structural validation (~30% of framework) but misses critical integration and consistency testing.

**Manual Verification**: Framework compliance currently relies on manual review and ad-hoc testing, creating reliability gaps and coordination friction.

**No Integration Testing**: Agent lifecycle processes (BOOTUP → Work → SHUTDOWN) are documented but not tested end-to-end with actual document updates.

**Cross-Document Drift Risk**: No validation that NEXT.md coordination matches role file assignments, or that 7EP status references remain accurate.

### Framework Maturity Gap

**Current State**: DDD framework is operationally complete but **validation-incomplete**
- 7EP-0017: Document architecture ✅
- 7EP-0019: Agent lifecycle patterns ✅  
- **Missing**: Systematic validation that ensures framework actually works as designed

**Strategic Risk**: Framework adoption success depends on reliability confidence. Without comprehensive validation, subtle coordination failures can undermine team effectiveness.

**Scalability Requirement**: Adding agents or expanding document scope requires validation systems that catch compliance issues before they create coordination problems.

### Validation Framework Requirements

**Complete System Coverage**: Validate all 4 framework layers:
1. **Technical Patterns** (AGENT.md compliance)
2. **Specifications** (7EP format consistency)
3. **Current Work** (role files ↔ NEXT.md coordination)
4. **Quality Standards** (document boundaries, workflow integration)

**CI Integration**: Automated enforcement prevents framework degradation through normal development cycles.

**Context Load Optimization**: Validation should reduce cognitive load by catching issues automatically vs agents discovering problems during work.

## Framework Validation Architecture

### Validation Scope Matrix

| Layer | Documents | Current Validation | Required Validation |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Technical** | AGENT.md | None | Build command accuracy, code style compliance |
| **Specifications** | docs/7eps/*.md | Basic format | Status accuracy, dependency validation, template compliance |
| **Current Work** | docs/development/ | Role files only | Cross-file consistency, workflow integration, session lifecycle |
| **Quality** | scripts/, workflows/ | Basic smoke test | Complete framework operational testing |
