# 7EP-0012: Mid-Session Task Handoff Protocol

**Status:** Draft  
**Author(s):** Claude Code (CC)  
**Assignment:** Shared (AC/CC coordination)  
**Difficulty:** 2 (process - establishes patterns for future use)  
**Created:** 2025-08-13  
**Updated:** 2025-08-13  

## Executive Summary

Establish a standardized protocol for mid-session task handoffs between AC and CC to optimize resource allocation, enable strategic repurposing, and maintain development momentum without losing work continuity.

## Evidence & Reasoning

**Current situation:**
- PR #19 (linting/CI configuration) is infrastructure work better suited for CC
- AC is actively monitoring PR #19 but could deliver higher value on TUI work
- No documented process for clean task handoffs mid-session
- Risk of work duplication or coordination gaps during transitions

**Why this protocol is needed:**
- **Resource optimization**: Match AI strengths to task types (CC=infrastructure, AC=user features)
- **Strategic flexibility**: Enable rapid repurposing when priorities shift
- **Work continuity**: Prevent loss of context or momentum during handoffs
- **Future scalability**: Reusable pattern for complex multi-AI coordination

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Case: Infrastructure ‚Üí Feature Repurposing
```
Current: AC working on PR #19 (linting/CI infrastructure)
Opportunity: TUI implementation (7EP-0010) available for AC
Solution: CC takes over PR #19, AC pivots to TUI work
Result: Both AIs work on optimal tasks simultaneously
```

### Secondary Use Cases
- **Emergency handoffs**: Critical issues requiring specific AI expertise
- **Workload balancing**: Redistribute when one AI becomes overloaded
- **Strategic pivots**: Rapid response to changing priorities
- **Cross-training**: Knowledge transfer between AI roles

## Technical Design

### Handoff Protocol Framework

#### 1. Handoff Triggers
```
STRATEGIC_REPURPOSE: Higher value work becomes available
EXPERTISE_MISMATCH: Task better suited for other AI  
WORKLOAD_BALANCE: Redistribute for optimal throughput
EMERGENCY_RESPONSE: Critical issue requires immediate attention
```

#### 2. Handoff Process
```
1. ASSESS: Evaluate current task state and handoff feasibility
2. DOCUMENT: Create handoff context in 7EP or issue comment
3. COORDINATE: Both AIs acknowledge handoff plan
4. TRANSFER: Receiving AI reviews context and confirms readiness
5. EXECUTE: Original AI provides final status, receiving AI takes over
6. VERIFY: Confirm successful transition and no dropped items
```

#### 3. Context Transfer Requirements
- **Current status**: What's done, what's in progress, what's blocked
- **Next steps**: Immediate actions and priorities
- **Key decisions**: Important choices made during development
- **Pitfalls**: Known issues or gotchas to avoid
- **Success criteria**: How to know when task is complete

### Handoff Documentation Template

1. [Priority action 1]
2. [Priority action 2]
3. [Priority action 3]

### Context & Decisions
- [Key technical decisions made]
- [Important context about approach]
- [Coordination points with other work]

- [ ] [Completion requirement 1]
- [ ] [Completion requirement 2]

### Handoff Confirmation
- [ ] Original AI: Handoff package complete
- [ ] Receiving AI: Context reviewed and understood
- [ ] Both: Ready to proceed
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Current Handoff (PR #19 ‚Üí CC)
- [ ] **Document PR #19 Current State**
  - CI status: 1 test failure on ubuntu-latest Go 1.22
  - Content: 7EP-0011 linting rules + test dataset system
  - Next steps: Fix test failure, handle CodeRabbit feedback, prepare for merge

- [ ] **Create Handoff Documentation**
  - Use template above for PR #19 ‚Üí CC transfer
  - Include specific technical context AC has gathered
  - Define success criteria for CC completion

- [ ] **Coordinate AC Repurposing**
  - Provide clear TUI task assignment (7EP-0010)
  - Ensure clean separation from PR #19 monitoring
  - Establish coordination checkpoints if needed

### Phase 2: Protocol Refinement
- [ ] **Usage Validation**
  - Monitor first handoff for process gaps
  - Collect feedback from both AIs
  - Refine template and process based on learnings

- [ ] **Integration with 7EP System**
  - Update other 7EPs to reference handoff protocols
  - Establish handoff consideration in planning phases
  - Document in CLAUDE.md for future sessions

### Dependencies
- Adam's approval of handoff strategy
- AC acknowledgment and readiness for TUI work
- Clear TUI task definition and priorities

## Testing Strategy

### Success Criteria for PR #19 Handoff
- [ ] CC successfully takes over PR #19 without missing context
- [ ] AC cleanly transitions to TUI work without workflow disruption
- [ ] No work duplication or coordination gaps
- [ ] Both tasks progress efficiently in parallel
- [ ] Handoff process is documented for future reference

### Process Validation
- Handoff completes within 1 session
- Both AIs understand their new responsibilities clearly
- No technical context is lost in transition
- Work quality maintained or improved post-handoff

## Migration/Compatibility

### Breaking Changes
None - this establishes new coordination patterns.

### Integration Requirements
- Update CLAUDE.md to reference handoff protocols
- Include handoff considerations in future 7EP planning
- Establish as standard practice for complex multi-AI projects

### Backward Compatibility
Fully compatible - enhances existing coordination without changing current workflows.

## Alternatives Considered

**Sequential task completion**: AC finishes PR #19 then starts TUI - rejected due to missed optimization opportunity and delayed TUI delivery.

**Parallel work without handoff**: Both AIs work on original assignments - rejected due to suboptimal resource allocation (AC better suited for TUI, CC for infrastructure).

**External coordination**: Using GitHub issues/comments for handoff - considered but decided 7EP provides better structured documentation and future reference.

## Future Considerations

- **Automated handoff triggers**: System detection of optimal task allocation
- **Cross-session handoffs**: Structured handoffs between different working sessions
- **Multi-AI orchestration**: Extend protocol for larger AI teams
- **Workload analytics**: Metrics on handoff effectiveness and optimization opportunities

## ACTIVE HANDOFF: PR #19 Linting Rules ‚Üí CC

### Current Status (AC ‚Üí CC)
**From**: AC ‚Üí **To**: CC  
**Date**: 2025-08-13  
**Reason**: STRATEGIC_REPURPOSE (AC better suited for TUI work)
**Branch**: `docs/7ep-0011-lint-tightening` (AC no longer touches this)

#### ‚úÖ Completed by AC
- Drafted 7EP-0011 and added to the 7EP index
- Opened PR #19 (includes 7EP-0011 plus related docs/test-dataset/display updates)
- CI: updated Build/Test/Quality workflows to use latest Go (stable) with check-latest: true
- CI: added env GOTOOLCHAIN=local to avoid toolchain auto-downloads/timeouts
- golangci-lint action runs with modules-download-mode=mod to ensure deps resolve in container
- Security scan (gosec) passes locally; deterministic RNG in test generator documented and suppressed with targeted #nosec G404

#### üîÑ In Progress (AC was monitoring)
- Monitoring PR #19 CI (Build/Test/Quality/Security)
- Will respond to CodeRabbit (CR) feedback

#### ‚è∏Ô∏è Blocked/Waiting
- ubuntu-latest Go 1.22 test failure (1 failing check)
- CI re-running after workflow updates
- Pending CodeRabbit review completion

#### Immediate Next Steps for CC
1. **Fix ubuntu-latest Go 1.22 test failure** - Check logs for specific issue
2. **Monitor CI completion** - Ensure all Build/Test/Quality/Security checks pass
3. **Address CodeRabbit feedback** - Respond to any review comments immediately

#### Key Context & Decisions from AC
- Updated CI to use Go stable with check-latest: true to avoid version conflicts
- Added GOTOOLCHAIN=local environment to prevent auto-downloads/timeouts
- Security scan configured with targeted #nosec G404 for test RNG (documented)
- golangci-lint uses modules-download-mode=mod for reliable dependency resolution

#### Success Criteria for CC
- [ ] All CI checks green (Build/Test/Quality/Security pass)
- [ ] CodeRabbit feedback addressed completely
- [ ] PR ready for Adam's merge approval

#### Handoff Confirmation
- [x] AC: Handoff documentation complete + switched away from PR #19 branch
- [x] CC: Context reviewed and ready to proceed
- [ ] Both: Handoff confirmed, AC moves to TUI
