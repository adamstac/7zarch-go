# 7EP-0014: Critical Foundation Gaps

**Status:** ✅ Implemented  
**Author(s):** Amp (Sourcegraph)  
**Assignment:** CC + AC (Shared Critical Path)  
**Difficulty:** 4 (architectural - multiple systems, data safety, breaking changes)  
**Created:** 2025-08-13  
**Updated:** 2025-08-13  
**Implementation:** 2025-08-13 (2 days, ahead of 4-6 day target)  

## Executive Summary

Address five critical foundation gaps that are blocking reliable CLI tool development and advanced feature implementation: database migration safety, CI pipeline reliability, complete trash lifecycle, machine-readable output, and shell completion baseline.

## Evidence & Reasoning

**User feedback/pain points:**
- Database schema changes risk data corruption with no migration/backup system
- CI failures mean unreliable builds and broken quality gates
- Incomplete delete/restore workflow feels unsafe and unprofessional  
- No JSON/CSV output blocks scripting and automation workflows
- Missing shell completion creates poor discoverability and forces memorization

**Current limitations:**
- **Database Evolution**: 7EP-0003 migration system still in Draft while schema actively evolving
- **CI Quality Gates**: PR #11 has merge conflicts + 2 failing checks, bypassing reliability
- **Trash Operations**: `restore`/`purge` commands missing, status integration incomplete
- **Automation Surface**: Only human-readable tables, no machine output formats
- **CLI Discoverability**: No tab completion for commands, IDs, paths, or flags

**Why now:**
- **Data Safety Critical**: Every new DB feature (search, queries, TUI) risks corruption without migrations
- **Quality Gate Bypass**: Advanced features can't ship reliably without working CI
- **User Confidence**: Incomplete trash lifecycle blocks trust in destructive operations
- **Integration Blocker**: No machine output prevents external tooling and advanced workflows
- **UX Foundation**: Shell completion should be baseline, not advanced feature

**Strategic Impact:**
- Current gaps force users to treat 7zarch-go as experimental rather than production-ready
- Advanced features (7EP-0007, 7EP-0010) will inherit these foundation weaknesses
- Fixing later requires breaking changes; fixing now provides stable platform

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Case: Safe Production Usage
```bash
# User upgrades version with database changes
7zarch-go list
# Output: "Applying 2 pending migrations... ✓ Complete"
# Database safely updated with automatic backup

# User accidentally deletes important archive
7zarch-go delete project-backup.7z
7zarch-go restore project-backup    # Works reliably

# User integrates with external tools
7zarch-go list --output json | jq '.[] | select(.status == "missing")'
# Machine-readable output enables automation

# User discovers commands and IDs naturally
7zarch-go sh<TAB>           # Completes to 'show'
7zarch-go show 01K2<TAB>    # Completes to full ULID
```

### Secondary Use Cases
- **Development reliability**: Contributors trust CI status and can merge safely
- **Scripting workflows**: External tools can parse and manipulate archive data
- **Operational confidence**: Delete/restore lifecycle feels safe and professional
- **Power user efficiency**: Tab completion reduces cognitive load and errors

## Technical Design

### Overview
Implement five critical foundation components in coordinated phases to establish reliable data safety, quality gates, complete workflows, automation interfaces, and discoverability baseline.

### Component 1: Database Migration System (7EP-0003 Implementation)
**Promote 7EP-0003 from Draft to Critical and implement immediately.**

```go
// Migration runner with safety guarantees
type MigrationRunner struct {
    db          *sql.DB
    backupPath  string
    timeout     time.Duration
}

func (mr *MigrationRunner) ApplyPending() error {
    // 1. Create timestamped backup
    // 2. Run migrations in transaction
    // 3. Validate schema integrity
    // 4. Rollback on any failure
}
```

**Commands:**
```bash
7zarch-go db status     # Show current schema version, pending migrations
7zarch-go db migrate    # Apply pending migrations with backup
7zarch-go db backup     # Create manual backup
```

### Component 2: CI Pipeline Reliability (Fix PR #11)
**Address immediate blockers in 7EP-0002 implementation.**

**Critical Fixes:**
- Resolve merge conflicts with main branch
- Fix lint/format check failures  
- Address security scan failures
- Re-enable required status checks

**Validation:**
```bash
# All checks must pass before merge
✓ Lint and Format
✓ Security Scan  
✓ Unit Tests
✓ Integration Tests
✓ Build Verification
```

### Component 3: Complete Trash Lifecycle (7EP-0001 Completion)
**Finish incomplete trash management implementation.**

```go
// Complete restore command
func runMasRestore(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
    resolver := storage.NewResolver(registry)
    archive, err := resolver.Resolve(args[0])
    if err != nil {
        return handleResolutionError(err)
    }
    
    if archive.Status != "deleted" {
        return &storage.InvalidOperationError{
            Operation: "restore",
            Archive:   archive,
            Reason:    "Archive is not deleted",
        }
    }
    
    return restoreArchiveFile(archive)
}

// Complete purge command  
func runMasTrashPurge(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
    // Support: specific ID, --older-than duration, --all
    // Safety: require --force for permanent deletion
    // Progress: show what's being purged
}
```

**Missing Commands to Implement:**
```bash
7zarch-go restore <id>                    # Restore from trash
7zarch-go trash purge [<id>]             # Permanent deletion
7zarch-go trash purge --older-than 30d   # Bulk purge by age
7zarch-go list --deleted                 # Show deleted archives
```

### Component 4: Machine-Readable Output
**Add structured output support to core commands.**

```go
type OutputFormat string
const (
    OutputTable OutputFormat = "table"
    OutputJSON  OutputFormat = "json" 
    OutputCSV   OutputFormat = "csv"
    OutputYAML  OutputFormat = "yaml"
)

// Add to all commands that return data
func (cmd *Command) AddOutputFlag() {
    cmd.Flags().String("output", "table", "Output format (table|json|csv|yaml)")
}
```

**Commands to Update:**
```bash
7zarch-go list --output json     # JSON array of archives
7zarch-go show <id> --output json # JSON object with archive details
7zarch-go trash list --output csv # CSV format for spreadsheet import
```

### Component 5: Basic Shell Completion
**Implement foundation completion for commands and basic IDs.**

```go
// Basic completion for cobra commands
func addCompletionSupport(rootCmd *cobra.Command) {
    // Command completion
    rootCmd.ValidArgsFunction = completeCommands
    
    // Archive ID completion for show/move/delete/restore
    showCmd.ValidArgsFunction = completeArchiveIDs
    moveCmd.ValidArgsFunction = completeArchiveIDs
    deleteCmd.ValidArgsFunction = completeArchiveIDs
    restoreCmd.ValidArgsFunction = completeArchiveIDs
}

func completeArchiveIDs(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string, toComplete string) ([]string, cobra.ShellCompDirective) {
    // Return ULID prefixes and archive names matching toComplete
    registry := getRegistry()
    return registry.CompletePrefixes(toComplete), cobra.ShellCompDirectiveNoFileComp
}
```

**Shell Scripts:**
```bash
# Generate completion scripts
7zarch-go completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/7zarch-go
7zarch-go completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_7zarch-go
7zarch-go completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/7zarch-go.fish
```

### API Changes

#### New Commands
```bash
# Database operations (7EP-0003)
7zarch-go db status
7zarch-go db migrate [--dry-run]
7zarch-go db backup

# Complete trash operations (7EP-0001)  
7zarch-go restore <id>
7zarch-go trash purge [<id>] [--older-than <duration>] [--force]

# Shell completion setup
7zarch-go completion <shell>
```

#### Enhanced Existing Commands
```bash
# Add machine-readable output to data commands
7zarch-go list --output (table|json|csv|yaml)
7zarch-go show <id> --output (json|yaml)
7zarch-go trash list --output (table|json|csv)

# Add deleted archive filtering
7zarch-go list --deleted
7zarch-go list --status (present|missing|deleted)
```

### Data Model Changes

#### Migration Infrastructure (7EP-0003)
```sql
-- New migration tracking table
CREATE TABLE schema_migrations (
    version TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    applied_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
    checksum TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

#### Trash Status Integration (7EP-0001)
```sql
-- Use existing columns, ensure proper indexing
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_archives_status ON archives(status);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_archives_deleted_at ON archives(deleted_at);
```

**Foundation Requirements:**
- **7EP-0004 MAS Foundation**: ✅ Complete (provides resolver, registry, error handling)
- **7EP-0001 Trash Scaffolding**: ✅ Partial (delete/move to trash works, restore/purge missing)

**Enablers for Future Work:**
- **7EP-0007 Enhanced MAS Operations**: Requires machine output and completion foundation
- **7EP-0010 TUI Application**: Requires reliable database migrations and complete workflows

## Testing Strategy

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Database migrations apply safely with automatic backup/rollback
- [ ] CI pipeline provides reliable quality gates for all PRs
- [ ] Complete delete → trash → restore → purge lifecycle works end-to-end
- [ ] Machine output formats enable external scripting and automation
- [ ] Shell completion works for commands, flags, and archive identifiers
- [ ] All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows
- [ ] Performance remains under established benchmarks (7EP-0006)

### Test Scenarios

#### Database Migration Testing
- Fresh installation migration from scratch
- Incremental upgrades with existing data
- Migration failure rollback scenarios
- Large database migration performance
- Concurrent access during migration

#### Trash Workflow Testing  
- Accidental deletion and immediate restore
- Bulk purge operations with age filtering
- Cross-device restore scenarios
- Permission handling and error recovery
- Integration with existing display modes

#### Output Format Testing
- JSON schema stability across releases
- CSV compatibility with spreadsheet tools
- YAML readability for configuration
- Large dataset performance (1000+ archives)
- Error handling in structured formats

#### Completion Testing
- Command and flag completion accuracy
- ULID prefix completion performance
- Cross-shell compatibility (bash/zsh/fish)
- Completion with large registries (10K+ archives)

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Migration operations**: <10s for typical database with backup
- **Trash operations**: <200ms for restore/purge of single archive
- **Output formatting**: <500ms for JSON export of 1000 archives
- **Completion queries**: <50ms for prefix completion on 10K archives

## Migration/Compatibility

### Breaking Changes
**None** - all changes are additive or fix existing incomplete functionality.

### Upgrade Path
- Database migrations handle schema evolution automatically
- New output formats are opt-in via flags
- Shell completion requires one-time setup script
- Trash commands complete existing delete workflow

### Backward Compatibility
**Full compatibility maintained:**
- All existing commands and flags continue working unchanged
- Default behavior unchanged (table output, no completion)
- Configuration format unchanged
- Data storage format evolved safely via migrations

## Alternatives Considered

**Defer foundation fixes until after advanced features**: Rejected because retrofitting safety and UX into complex systems is significantly harder and creates technical debt.

**External migration tools**: Considered tools like golang-migrate but built-in system provides better integration and doesn't require external dependencies.

**Separate CLI for database operations**: Evaluated `7zarch-db` separate tool but decided integrated `db` subcommand provides better UX and reduces binary distribution complexity.

**Manual shell completion**: Considered shipping static completion files but dynamic completion provides better accuracy and stays current with command changes.

**Web-based output**: Evaluated HTML output format but JSON/CSV covers automation needs while maintaining CLI-first philosophy.

## Future Considerations

### Enhanced Migration Features
- **Migration rollback**: Reverse migrations for downgrades
- **Schema validation**: Automated integrity checks and repair
- **Cross-device sync**: Migration coordination across multiple registry instances

### Advanced Output Features  
- **Query output**: Machine-readable saved query export/import
- **Streaming output**: Handle very large datasets without memory issues
- **Custom formats**: User-defined output templates

### Completion Enhancements
- **Fuzzy completion**: Approximate matching for archive names
- **Context-aware completion**: Different suggestions based on command context
- **Smart suggestions**: Recently used archives, common patterns

### CI/CD Evolution
- **Performance benchmarks**: Automated performance regression detection
- **Security scanning**: Advanced vulnerability detection and dependency audits
- **Multi-platform testing**: Automated testing across all supported platforms
