# Documentation Architecture Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive documentation structure for 7zarch-go that goes far beyond a simple README.

## Documentation Philosophy

**Target Audiences:**
- **New Users**: Quick start and basic usage
- **Power Users**: Advanced workflows and automation
- **Integrators**: API usage and scripting
- **Contributors**: Development and extension
- **Operators**: Deployment and maintenance

**Documentation Principles:**
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, build to advanced
- **Example-Driven**: Every concept has working examples
- **Searchable**: Well-organized and discoverable
- **Maintainable**: Automated where possible, version controlled
