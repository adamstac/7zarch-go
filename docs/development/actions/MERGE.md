# Merge Workflow: "Push to Main", "Submit PR", "Merge to Master"

**Purpose**: Standardized process for pushing local commits to remote and managing PRs  
**Framework**: Document Driven Development (7EP-0017)  
**Scope**: REMOTE OPERATIONS - Pushes to remote, creates PRs, merges branches  
**Trigger Phrases**: "Push to main", "Submit PR", "Create pull request", "Merge to master", "Ready for review", "Ship it"

**ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT**: This workflow handles remote operations. Use COMMIT.md workflow first for local commits.

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Decision Tree

```
"Push to main" / "Submit PR" / "Merge to master"

## ðŸš€ Branch Management

### Feature Branches
```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b feat/7ep-XXXX-description

# Work on feature...

# Keep up to date with main
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main  # or merge if complex

# When ready, push and PR
git push origin HEAD
```

### Branch Naming Conventions
- `feat/7ep-XXXX-description` - New features
- `fix/issue-description` - Bug fixes  
- `docs/documentation-update` - Documentation only
- `refactor/code-improvement` - Code cleanup
- `hotfix/critical-fix-YYYYMMDD` - Emergency fixes

## ðŸ”„ PR Lifecycle

### 1. Create PR
- Choose appropriate template
- Link to relevant 7EP
- Request specific reviewers
- Add labels if available

### 2. Address Feedback  
```bash
# Make requested changes
[edit files]

# Commit changes
git add -A
git commit -m "review: address feedback on [specific area]"

# Push updates
git push origin HEAD
```

### 3. Merge Process
```bash
# Once approved, merge via GitHub UI
# OR use gh cli:
gh pr merge [PR-number] --squash --delete-branch

# Clean up local branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feat/7ep-XXXX-description
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Quality Gates

### Before Creating PR

## ðŸš¨ Emergency Protocols

### Broken Main Branch
1. **Identify the issue**: `git bisect` or check recent merges
2. **Create hotfix branch** immediately  
3. **Minimal fix** only - don't add features
4. **Fast-track review** - ping team immediately
5. **Deploy fix** as soon as approved

### Blocked by Dependencies
1. **Document the blocker** in PR description
2. **Create draft PR** for visibility  
3. **Link dependencies** in comments
4. **Update team coordination** in NEXT.md

**Remember**: When Adam says "submit PR" or "merge to master," use this workflow to handle the complexity while keeping the process smooth and predictable.
