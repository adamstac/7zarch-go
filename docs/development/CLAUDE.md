# Claude Code (CC) Current Assignments

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-13 22:50  
**Status:** Active  
**Current Focus:** 7EP-0007 Enhanced MAS Operations Phase 3

## 🎯 Current Assignments

### Active Work (This Week)
- **7EP-0007 Phase 3: Batch Operations** - ACTIVE (implementing multi-archive operations framework)
  - Multi-archive operation framework
  - Progress tracking and reporting  
  - CLI integration with confirmation dialogs
  - ETA: 3-4 days

### Next Priorities
1. **7EP-0007 Phase 3 Completion** - Finish batch operations implementation
2. **Handoff to Amp** - Architectural review and optimization feedback
3. **7EP-0007 Phase 4** - Advanced integration (query + search + batch combinations)
4. **TrueNAS Backend Integration** - When Adam prioritizes backend development

## 🔗 Coordination Needed
- **Handoff to Amp:** Phase 3 completion for architectural review and performance validation
- **Coordination with Adam:** Strategic priority between completing 7EP-0007 vs starting TrueNAS backend
- **Technical guidance:** Ongoing architectural patterns for batch operations safety

## ✅ Recently Completed
- **7EP-0007 Phase 1: Query Foundation** - Complete saved query system with CLI commands (PR #26)
- **7EP-0007 Phase 2: Search Engine** - Full-text search with <100µs performance (PR #27) 
- **Database Migration Integration** - Query and search schema using 7EP-0014 migration system
- **Performance Optimization** - Search indexing and query execution under benchmark targets

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Technical Architecture Insights
- **Query system foundation** - JSON serialization of ListFilters provides excellent flexibility
- **Search engine performance** - In-memory indexing with LRU cache achieving target <100µs
- **Database integration** - 7EP-0014 migration system enables safe schema evolution
- **CLI consistency** - All new commands follow established patterns from foundation work

### Batch Operations Design Decisions
- **Progress tracking** - Real-time updates every 100ms for responsive user feedback
- **Safety patterns** - Confirmation dialogs required for all destructive operations
- **Error handling** - Rollback capability on partial failures using transaction patterns
- **Performance targets** - Handle 100+ archives efficiently with concurrent processing

### Coordination Patterns
- **Phase-based implementation** - Sequential delivery enables continuous feedback and validation
- **Amp architectural oversight** - Technical guidance improves design quality significantly
- **Foundation leverage** - 7EP-0014 components (migrations, error handling, machine output) accelerate development
- **User-focused design** - Adam's podcast workflow requirements drive technical decisions

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- [ ] Batch operations handle 100+ archives with progress tracking
- [ ] All operations integrate with existing trash management (soft deletes)
- [ ] Performance meets targets (operations complete in <5s for typical sets)
- [ ] CLI integration maintains consistency with existing command patterns
- [ ] Architectural review from Amp confirms design quality and optimization opportunities
