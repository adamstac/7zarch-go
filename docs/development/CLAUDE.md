# Claude Code (CC) Current Assignments

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-14 16:45  
**Status:** Available  
**Current Focus:** Ready for strategic assignment

## üéØ Current Assignments

### Active Work (This Week)
- **Available for Strategic Assignment** - READY (all framework work complete, awaiting Adam's focus area decision)
- **Documentation Maintenance** - ONGOING (keeping team coordination documents current)
- **Framework Oversight** - ONGOING (ensuring DDD operational effectiveness)

### Next Priorities
1. **Strategic Assignment** - Begin next major focus when Adam sets direction (TUI vs TrueNAS vs optimization)
2. **Major Feature Implementation** - Execute chosen strategic direction with full focus
3. **Framework Refinement** - Improve coordination patterns based on operational feedback
4. **Technical Excellence** - Maintain code quality and architecture standards

## üîó Coordination Needed
- **Strategic Decision from Adam:** Next major focus area (TUI evolution vs TrueNAS backend vs optimization focus)
- **Sprint Planning:** Resource allocation and timeline planning once direction set
- **Cross-team Coordination:** Support AC with user-facing work as strategic direction requires

## ‚úÖ Recently Completed
- **üéâ 7EP-0007 FULLY COMPLETE** - All 3 phases merged to main (4,338 total lines)
  - **Phase 1: Query Foundation** - Complete saved query system (PR #26/merged in #27)
  - **Phase 2: Search Engine** - ~60-100¬µs search performance, 5000x faster than target (PR #27)
  - **Phase 3: Batch Operations** - Enterprise-grade multi-archive operations with safety (PR #28)
- **Enterprise Transformation Complete** - Basic archive manager ‚Üí Power user command center
- **Safety & Performance** - All 4 critical Amp-t safety issues resolved before merge

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Technical Architecture Insights
- **Query system foundation** - JSON serialization of ListFilters provides excellent flexibility
- **Search engine performance** - In-memory indexing with LRU cache achieving target <100¬µs
- **Database integration** - 7EP-0014 migration system enables safe schema evolution
- **CLI consistency** - All new commands follow established patterns from foundation work

### Batch Operations Design Decisions
- **Progress tracking** - Real-time updates every 100ms for responsive user feedback
- **Safety patterns** - Confirmation dialogs required for all destructive operations
- **Error handling** - Rollback capability on partial failures using transaction patterns
- **Performance targets** - Handle 100+ archives efficiently with concurrent processing

### Coordination Patterns
- **Phase-based implementation** - Sequential delivery enables continuous feedback and validation
- **Amp architectural oversight** - Technical guidance improves design quality significantly
- **Foundation leverage** - 7EP-0014 components (migrations, error handling, machine output) accelerate development
- **User-focused design** - Adam's podcast workflow requirements drive technical decisions

## üéØ Success Criteria
- [ ] Batch operations handle 100+ archives with progress tracking
- [ ] All operations integrate with existing trash management (soft deletes)
- [ ] Performance meets targets (operations complete in <5s for typical sets)
- [ ] CLI integration maintains consistency with existing command patterns
- [ ] Architectural review from Amp confirms design quality and optimization opportunities
