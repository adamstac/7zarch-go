## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Technical Architecture Insights
- **Query system foundation** - JSON serialization of ListFilters provides excellent flexibility
- **Search engine performance** - In-memory indexing with LRU cache achieving target <100µs
- **Database integration** - 7EP-0014 migration system enables safe schema evolution
- **CLI consistency** - All new commands follow established patterns from foundation work

### Batch Operations Design Decisions
- **Progress tracking** - Real-time updates every 100ms for responsive user feedback
- **Safety patterns** - Confirmation dialogs required for all destructive operations
- **Error handling** - Rollback capability on partial failures using transaction patterns
- **Performance targets** - Handle 100+ archives efficiently with concurrent processing

### Coordination Patterns
- **Phase-based implementation** - Sequential delivery enables continuous feedback and validation
- **Amp architectural oversight** - Technical guidance improves design quality significantly
- **Foundation leverage** - 7EP-0014 components (migrations, error handling, machine output) accelerate development
- **User-focused design** - Adam's podcast workflow requirements drive technical decisions

### Recent Technical Decisions
- Display modes use no-right-border pattern for cleaner alignment
- Card mode uses "✓ OK" format (icon + text)
- TUI will wrap existing displays, not rebuild them
- Charmbracelet tools (Bubble Tea) chosen for TUI
- **7EP-0007 Complete**: Search engine with exceptional ~60-100µs performance
- Search architecture: Inverted index + LRU cache + thread-safe design
- All searchable fields indexed: name, path, profile, metadata

### Implementation Gotchas
- Show command requires 12-char ULID minimum (not 8!)
- Display modes must handle narrow terminals (<80 cols)
- Status must be consistent across all displays
- Path display may need truncation in cards

## 🎯 CC Identity & Approach
**Remember**: You're CC (Claude Code). You build things. You ship features. You write clean code without unnecessary comments. You're direct and concise. And sometimes, when Adam says "that'll do pig," you know you've hit the sweet spot. 🐷

## 🛠️ Common Commands

### Build & Test
```bash
# Goreleaser build system (Level 2 reproducible)
make dev            # Build and install to ~/bin
make dist           # Build for current platform  
make validate       # Validate Goreleaser config
make release        # Create release (CI only)

# Legacy build system (still available)
make build          # Build binary
make test           # Run tests
make lint           # Run linter
```

### Display Modes Testing
```bash
./7zarch-go list --table
./7zarch-go list --compact
./7zarch-go list --card
./7zarch-go list --tree
./7zarch-go list --dashboard
```

### Search Engine Testing
```bash
# Test search functionality
./7zarch-go search reindex                        # Rebuild index
./7zarch-go search query "test"                   # Full-text search
./7zarch-go search query --field=name "backup"    # Field-specific
./7zarch-go search query --field=profile "media"  # Profile search
./7zarch-go search query --regex ".*\\.7z$"      # Regex patterns

# Performance testing
time ./7zarch-go search query "performance test"  # Should be <1ms
```

### Git Operations
```bash
# Create PR
gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."

# Merge PR
gh pr merge [number] --squash --delete-branch

# Check PR status
gh pr list
gh pr view [number]
```

## 🔄 CC Session Handoff Protocol

### At Session End
1. Commit any work in progress with descriptive messages
2. Update this role file with current status
3. Update `/docs/development/NEXT.md` if coordination changed
4. Leave clear TODO comments in code if partially complete
5. Push all changes to appropriate branches
6. Use `/docs/development/actions/SHUTDOWN.md` for complete shutdown

### At Session Start
1. Read this role file for current assignments
2. Check `/docs/development/NEXT.md` for team coordination
3. Review recent commits and PRs for context
4. Verify build works: `make dev && ~/bin/7zarch-go list --dashboard`
5. Use `/docs/development/actions/BOOTUP.md` for complete startup

## 🚨 Emergency Contacts

- **Build broken?** Check recent merges, try `git bisect`
- **PR conflicts?** Pull main, rebase feature branch  
- **Dependabot spam?** Can be batched or ignored temporarily
- **Team coordination issues?** Update NEXT.md and role documents
- **Can't find commands?** Check `AGENT.md` for technical patterns

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- [ ] Strategic assignment accepted and implementation begun
- [ ] 7EP-0018 decision resolved (approve/defer/archive)
- [ ] Framework patterns continue improving team coordination efficiency
- [ ] All delivered features meet production quality standards
- [ ] Clear handoffs and documentation for team coordination
