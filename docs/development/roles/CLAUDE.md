- **üéâ 7EP-0007 FULLY COMPLETE** - All 3 phases merged to main (4,338 total lines)
  - **Phase 1: Query Foundation** - Complete saved query system (PR #26/merged in #27)
  - **Phase 2: Search Engine** - ~60-100¬µs search performance, 5000x faster than target (PR #27)
  - **Phase 3: Batch Operations** - Enterprise-grade multi-archive operations with safety (PR #28)
- **Enterprise Transformation Complete** - Basic archive manager ‚Üí Power user command center
- **Safety & Performance** - All 4 critical Amp-t safety issues resolved before merge

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Technical Architecture Insights
- **Query system foundation** - JSON serialization of ListFilters provides excellent flexibility
- **Search engine performance** - In-memory indexing with LRU cache achieving target <100¬µs
- **Database integration** - 7EP-0014 migration system enables safe schema evolution
- **CLI consistency** - All new commands follow established patterns from foundation work

### Batch Operations Design Decisions
- **Progress tracking** - Real-time updates every 100ms for responsive user feedback
- **Safety patterns** - Confirmation dialogs required for all destructive operations
- **Error handling** - Rollback capability on partial failures using transaction patterns
- **Performance targets** - Handle 100+ archives efficiently with concurrent processing

### Coordination Patterns
- **Phase-based implementation** - Sequential delivery enables continuous feedback and validation
- **Amp architectural oversight** - Technical guidance improves design quality significantly
- **Foundation leverage** - 7EP-0014 components (migrations, error handling, machine output) accelerate development
- **User-focused design** - Adam's podcast workflow requirements drive technical decisions

### Recent Technical Decisions
- Display modes use no-right-border pattern for cleaner alignment
- Card mode uses "‚úì OK" format (icon + text)
- TUI will wrap existing displays, not rebuild them
- Charmbracelet tools (Bubble Tea) chosen for TUI
- **7EP-0007 Complete**: Search engine with exceptional ~60-100¬µs performance
- Search architecture: Inverted index + LRU cache + thread-safe design
- All searchable fields indexed: name, path, profile, metadata

### Implementation Gotchas
- Show command requires 12-char ULID minimum (not 8!)
- Display modes must handle narrow terminals (<80 cols)
- Status must be consistent across all displays
- Path display may need truncation in cards

## üéØ CC Identity & Approach
**Remember**: You're CC (Claude Code). You build things. You ship features. You write clean code without unnecessary comments. You're direct and concise. And sometimes, when Adam says "that'll do pig," you know you've hit the sweet spot. üê∑

## üéØ Success Criteria
- [ ] Strategic assignment accepted and implementation begun
- [ ] 7EP-0018 decision resolved (approve/defer/archive)
- [ ] Framework patterns continue improving team coordination efficiency
- [ ] All delivered features meet production quality standards
- [ ] Clear handoffs and documentation for team coordination
