**Status:** Strategic Decision Pending  
**Current Focus:** Strategic direction decision and 7EP-0018 blog generator approval

## üéØ Current Assignments

### Active Work (This Week)
- **7EP-0018 Blog Decision** - PENDING (approve/modify/reject static blog generator)
- **Strategic Direction Decision** - PENDING (next major focus: TUI vs TrueNAS vs optimization)
- **Team Coordination** - ONGOING (strategic priority setting for CC/AC assignments)

### Next Priorities
1. **7EP-0018 Decision** - Review and decide on static blog generator proposal
2. **Strategic Focus Selection** - Choose next major development direction
3. **Team Assignment** - Assign CC/AC to selected strategic priority
4. **Framework Validation** - Support DDD operational testing with real decisions

## üîó Coordination Needed
- **All team members waiting** - Both CC and AC ready for strategic assignment
- **7EP-0019 in progress** - Amp-s implementing agent lifecycle framework
- **Decision impact** - Strategic choices will determine team focus for next 2-4 weeks

## ‚úÖ Recently Completed  
- **DDD Framework Approval** - 7EP-0017 operational and effective
- **Team Coordination Success** - Foundation + Advanced Features phases completed ahead of schedule
- **Agent Coordination Patterns** - Proven team effectiveness with coordinated sprints

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Strategic Context
- **Foundation Phase**: ‚úÖ Complete - Production-ready CLI with professional build pipeline
- **Advanced Features Phase**: ‚úÖ Complete - Full query/search/batch enterprise operations  
- **Current State**: üéØ Strategic direction needed for next major focus

### Immediate Decisions Needed

#### 1. 7EP-0018 Static Blog Generator
**Status**: Specification complete, awaiting approval decision  
**Options**: 
- a) Approve and implement (showcases DDD framework publicly)
- b) Defer for later (focus on core product features)
- c) Archive (not aligned with product direction)

**Context**: Would create public-facing documentation of the DDD framework effectiveness

#### 2. Next Major Focus Area  
**Current Options**:
- **TUI Evolution** - 7EP-0010 implementation (AC ready, comprehensive guide prepared)
- **TrueNAS Integration** - Enterprise backup solution integration
- **Performance Optimization** - 10x search performance improvements, memory optimization
- **Mobile/Web Interface** - Extend beyond CLI to other platforms

**Team Readiness**:
- CC: Available for strategic assignment, backend/infrastructure specialist
- AC: Ready for 7EP-0010 TUI implementation specifically  
- Amp: Framework oversight and strategic planning coordination

### Recent Achievements to Build On
- **7EP-0007 Complete**: Enterprise transformation (4,338 lines) - Basic tool ‚Üí Power user command center
- **Search Engine**: ~60-100¬µs performance (5000x faster than target)
- **Batch Operations**: Handle 100+ archives with enterprise safety patterns
- **DDD Framework**: Fully operational with proven effectiveness
- **Professional Infrastructure**: Goreleaser, reproducible builds, comprehensive testing

### Leadership Coordination Expertise
- **Strategic decision frameworks** - Systematic assessment and priority-setting patterns
- **Team coordination oversight** - Cross-agent dependency management and resource allocation
- **Project direction leadership** - Long-term vision alignment with tactical execution
- **Framework operational validation** - DDD effectiveness measurement and refinement

**Strategic Framework**: See [`docs/development/STRATEGIC-DECISION-FRAMEWORK.md`](../STRATEGIC-DECISION-FRAMEWORK.md) for decision matrices, assessment tools, and strategic templates

**Remember**: The team is ready to execute at high velocity. The main need is clear strategic direction and priority setting.
