# Adam (Project Lead) Current Context

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-15  
**Status:** Strategic Decision Pending  
**Current Focus:** Strategic direction decision and 7EP-0018 blog generator approval

## 🎯 Current Assignments

### Active Work (This Week)
- **7EP-0018 Blog Decision** - PENDING (approve/modify/reject static blog generator)
- **Strategic Direction Decision** - PENDING (next major focus: TUI vs TrueNAS vs optimization)
- **Team Coordination** - ONGOING (strategic priority setting for CC/AC assignments)

### Next Priorities
1. **7EP-0018 Decision** - Review and decide on static blog generator proposal
2. **Strategic Focus Selection** - Choose next major development direction
3. **Team Assignment** - Assign CC/AC to selected strategic priority
4. **Framework Validation** - Support DDD operational testing with real decisions

## 🔗 Coordination Needed
- **All team members waiting** - Both CC and AC ready for strategic assignment
- **7EP-0019 in progress** - Amp-s implementing agent lifecycle framework
- **Decision impact** - Strategic choices will determine team focus for next 2-4 weeks

## ✅ Recently Completed  
- **DDD Framework Approval** - 7EP-0017 operational and effective
- **Team Coordination Success** - Foundation + Advanced Features phases completed ahead of schedule
- **Agent Coordination Patterns** - Proven team effectiveness with coordinated sprints

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Strategic Context
- **Foundation Phase**: ✅ Complete - Production-ready CLI with professional build pipeline
- **Advanced Features Phase**: ✅ Complete - Full query/search/batch enterprise operations  
- **Current State**: 🎯 Strategic direction needed for next major focus

### Immediate Decisions Needed

#### 1. 7EP-0018 Static Blog Generator
**Status**: Specification complete, awaiting approval decision  
**Options**: 
- a) Approve and implement (showcases DDD framework publicly)
- b) Defer for later (focus on core product features)
- c) Archive (not aligned with product direction)

**Context**: Would create public-facing documentation of the DDD framework effectiveness

#### 2. Next Major Focus Area  
**Current Options**:
- **TUI Evolution** - 7EP-0010 implementation (AC ready, comprehensive guide prepared)
- **TrueNAS Integration** - Enterprise backup solution integration
- **Performance Optimization** - 10x search performance improvements, memory optimization
- **Mobile/Web Interface** - Extend beyond CLI to other platforms

**Team Readiness**:
- CC: Available for strategic assignment, backend/infrastructure specialist
- AC: Ready for 7EP-0010 TUI implementation specifically  
- Amp: Framework oversight and strategic planning coordination

### Recent Achievements to Build On
- **7EP-0007 Complete**: Enterprise transformation (4,338 lines) - Basic tool → Power user command center
- **Search Engine**: ~60-100µs performance (5000x faster than target)
- **Batch Operations**: Handle 100+ archives with enterprise safety patterns
- **DDD Framework**: Fully operational with proven effectiveness
- **Professional Infrastructure**: Goreleaser, reproducible builds, comprehensive testing

## 🎯 Leadership Actions Available

### Check Team Coordination Status
```bash
# See what's blocking the team
cat docs/development/NEXT.md | head -30

# Check individual agent status
cat docs/development/roles/CLAUDE.md | head -20
cat docs/development/roles/AUGMENT.md | head -20

# Review any draft 7EPs awaiting approval
ls docs/7eps/ | grep -i draft
```

### Review Strategic Options
```bash
# Check 7EP-0018 blog generator specification
cat docs/7eps/7EP-0018-*.md

# Review TUI readiness status
cat docs/7eps/7EP-0010-*.md

# See completed foundation work
git log --oneline -20 | grep -E "(7EP-0007|7EP-0015|7EP-0013|7EP-0014)"
```

### Set Strategic Direction
```bash
# Assign specific 7EP to agent
echo "## 🎯 Strategic Decision: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" >> docs/development/NEXT.md
echo "**Direction**: [Chosen focus area]" >> docs/development/NEXT.md
echo "**Assignment**: [Agent] to begin [7EP-XXXX]" >> docs/development/NEXT.md
echo "**Timeline**: [Expected milestone dates]" >> docs/development/NEXT.md

# Update agent role assignment
echo "## 🎯 New Assignment: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" >> docs/development/roles/[AGENT].md
echo "**Focus**: [Specific work details]" >> docs/development/roles/[AGENT].md
echo "**Priority**: [Why this work is important now]" >> docs/development/roles/[AGENT].md
```

**Strategic Framework**: See [`docs/development/STRATEGIC-DECISION-FRAMEWORK.md`](../STRATEGIC-DECISION-FRAMEWORK.md) for decision matrices, assessment tools, and strategic templates

## 🔄 Coordination Protocol

### When Making Decisions
1. **Update NEXT.md** with the decision and rationale
2. **Assign specific agent** with clear scope and timeline
3. **Update agent role document** with new priority
4. **Set checkpoint reviews** for progress and course correction

### Team Communication
- **NEXT.md**: Primary coordination document for cross-team decisions
- **Role documents**: Agent-specific assignments and current focus
- **7EP documents**: Detailed feature specifications and progress tracking
- **Session logs**: Real-time work documentation and handoffs

**Remember**: The team is ready to execute at high velocity. The main need is clear strategic direction and priority setting.
