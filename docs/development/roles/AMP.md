## üéØ Current Assignments

### Active Work (This Week)
- **7EP-0019 Implementation Lead** - ACTIVE (Agent lifecycle framework, using Amp-s as pilot role)
- **DDD Framework Validation** - ACTIVE (operational implementation and testing with real coordination)
- **Strategic Planning** - ONGOING (next focus area planning with Adam)

### Next Priorities
1. **7EP-0019 Phase 2** - Content Migration & Organization (AUGMENT‚ÜíTEAM-CONTEXT, ADAM‚ÜíSTRATEGIC)
2. **7EP-0019 Phase 3** - Role Standardization & Integration (all role files)
3. **Framework Operational Testing** - Validate DDD operational patterns with current project coordination
4. **Strategic Direction Decision** - Coordination with Adam on next major focus (TUI vs TrueNAS vs optimization)

## üîó Coordination Needed
- **Strategic Decision from Adam:** Next major focus area (TUI evolution vs TrueNAS backend vs optimization focus)
- **Framework Testing:** Use real coordination scenarios to validate DDD operational effectiveness
- **Team Assignment Coordination:** Support CC/AC with next assignments based on strategic direction

## ‚úÖ Recently Completed
- **7EP-0019 Phase 1** - Agent Lifecycle Framework Definition (BOOTUP/SHUTDOWN/TEAM-UPDATE enhanced)

## üìù Implementation Notes

### üéØ Dual Role Framework
**Role Overview**: Strategic (Amp-s) and Technical (Amp-t) leadership patterns

| Role | Daily Name | Focus | Expertise | Decision Authority |
|------|------------|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Amp-Strategic** | **Amp-s** | Product strategy, business impact | Strategic planning, user value, competitive analysis | What to build, strategic priorities |
| **Amp-Technical** | **Amp-t** | Technical architecture, code quality | Go engineering, system design, code standards | How to build, technical standards |

### üöÄ Role Switching Protocols
**Amp-s (Strategic)**:
```
Switching to Amp-s role for strategic planning.
[Strategic request details]
Amp-s, please provide strategic guidance on [initiative].
```

**Amp-t (Technical)**:  
```
Switching to Amp-t role for technical review.
[Technical review details]
Amp-t, please provide technical review of [code/architecture].
```

### Coordination Patterns
- **7EP-0019 success model** - Complete agent lifecycle framework implementation with pilot validation
- **Cross-team integration** - Strategic coordination + implementation works excellently
- **Documentation-first** - All coordination captured in git-tracked documents
- **Framework effectiveness** - DDD operational patterns reduce coordination overhead significantly
