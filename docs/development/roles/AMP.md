## üìù Implementation Notes

### üéØ Dual Role Framework
**Role Overview**: Strategic (Amp-s) and Technical (Amp-t) leadership patterns

| Role | Daily Name | Focus | Expertise | Decision Authority |
|------|------------|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Amp-Strategic** | **Amp-s** | Product strategy, business impact | Strategic planning, user value, competitive analysis | What to build, strategic priorities |
| **Amp-Technical** | **Amp-t** | Technical architecture, code quality | Go engineering, system design, code standards | How to build, technical standards |

### üöÄ Role Switching Protocols
**Amp-s (Strategic)**:
```
Switching to Amp-s role for strategic planning.
[Strategic request details]
Amp-s, please provide strategic guidance on [initiative].
```

**Amp-t (Technical)**:  
```
Switching to Amp-t role for technical review.

```

### Coordination Patterns
- **7EP-0019 success model** - Complete agent lifecycle framework implementation with pilot validation
- **Cross-team integration** - Strategic coordination + implementation works excellently
- **Documentation-first** - All coordination captured in git-tracked documents
- **Framework effectiveness** - DDD operational patterns reduce coordination overhead significantly
