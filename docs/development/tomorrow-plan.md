# Tomorrow's Development Plan

**Date**: 2025-08-13  
**Status**: 7EP-0009 Complete âœ… | Main branch clean | 5 PRs merged

## ðŸŽ¯ Options for Tomorrow (CC)

### Option 1: Fix Critical Blockers
**PR #11 (CI Integration) + PR #12 (Test Dataset)**
- Resolve merge conflicts from 7EP-0008 changes
- Fix 15 compilation errors in test dataset
- Get CI pipeline green across all platforms
- **Effort**: 4-6 hours
- **Impact**: Unblocks Phase 3, enables full CI/CD

### Option 2: Start 7EP-0007 Enhanced MAS Operations
**New feature work while AC handles Phase 2**
- Implement advanced search infrastructure
- Add batch operation core
- Build shell completion system
- **Effort**: Full day
- **Impact**: Major user-facing improvements

### Option 3: Support AC on 7EP-0010 TUI
**If AC tackles the TUI overnight**
- Review and enhance TUI implementation
- Add missing display modes to TUI
- Polish keyboard navigation
- **Effort**: 2-4 hours
- **Impact**: Complete interactive experience

## ðŸŒ™ AC Overnight Deep Feature Option

### 7EP-0010: Interactive TUI Application
**Perfect for deep, uninterrupted work**

**Why it's ideal for overnight:**
- Self-contained feature with clear boundaries
- No dependencies on other pending work
- Creative UI/UX work benefits from flow state
- Can iterate rapidly without coordination needs

**Core Implementation (8-10 hours):**
```go
// Main TUI components to build
- Dashboard view (default entry point)
- List view with filtering
- Detail view for archive inspection
- Operations menu (create, delete, move, etc.)
- Settings/preferences panel
- Help/command reference
```

**Key Features:**
- Bubble Tea framework integration
- Keyboard navigation (vim-style bindings)
- Real-time updates and refresh
- Context-sensitive help
- Multi-panel layouts
- Smooth transitions between views

**Technical Approach:**
1. Start with basic Bubble Tea app structure
2. Implement dashboard as entry point (reuse dashboard display logic)
3. Add navigation between views
4. Implement keyboard shortcuts progressively
5. Add operation confirmations and feedback
6. Polish with colors, borders, and smooth updates

**Deliverables:**
- New `tui` command to launch interactive mode
- Complete keyboard navigation
- All 5 display modes accessible interactively
- Operations menu with confirmations
- Help system with command reference

## ðŸ“Š Current State Summary

### What's Working
- âœ… Full MAS foundation (ULID resolution, show, list, move)
- âœ… Enhanced display system (5 modes, auto-detection)
- âœ… CodeRabbit integration
- âœ… Clean main branch

### Active Work
- ðŸ”„ PR #9: List filters (AC working)
- ðŸ”„ PR #10: Trash management (AC next)

### Blocked/Broken
- ðŸ”´ PR #11: CI integration (conflicts + failures)
- ðŸ”´ PR #12: Test dataset (15 compilation errors)

## ðŸš€ Recommendation

### For Tonight (AC)
**Go for 7EP-0010 TUI!** 
- High impact user feature
- Perfect for deep work session
- No blocking dependencies
- Will wow users with interactivity

### For Tomorrow (CC)
**Start with Option 1 (Fix Blockers)**
- Unblock Phase 3 early in the day
- Then pivot to either:
  - Support AC's TUI work if needed
  - Start 7EP-0007 infrastructure

This approach maximizes parallel work, delivers user value quickly, and clears technical debt.

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Outcomes

**By end of tomorrow:**
- 7EP-0010 TUI potentially complete (if AC tackles overnight)
- CI/CD pipeline green and operational
- Test dataset system functional
- 7/10 total 7EPs implemented
- ~70% of roadmap complete

**User wins:**
- Interactive TUI for intuitive archive management
- 5 display modes in both CLI and TUI
- Robust CI/CD ensuring quality
- Comprehensive test coverage
