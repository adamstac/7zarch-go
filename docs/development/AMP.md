## üéØ Current Assignments

### Active Work (This Week)
- **Available for Assignment** - READY (7EP-0017 framework complete, awaiting strategic direction)
- **DDD Framework Validation** - ACTIVE (operational implementation and testing with real coordination)
- **Strategic Planning** - ONGOING (next focus area planning with Adam)

### Next Priorities
1. **Strategic Direction Decision** - Coordination with Adam on next major focus (TUI vs TrueNAS vs optimization)
2. **Framework Operational Testing** - Validate DDD operational patterns with current project coordination
3. **7EP-0016 TUI Evolution** - Ready to begin if frontend development prioritized
4. **Architectural Review** - Available for technical oversight as needed

## üîó Coordination Needed
- **Strategic Decision from Adam:** Next major focus area (TUI evolution vs TrueNAS backend vs optimization focus)
- **Framework Testing:** Use real coordination scenarios to validate DDD operational effectiveness
- **Team Assignment Coordination:** Support CC/AC with next assignments based on strategic direction

## ‚úÖ Recently Completed
- **7EP-0010 TUI Implementation** - Simple themed interface with 9 color schemes and browse command
- **7EP-0014 Foundation Sprint** - 2-day coordination of critical foundation gaps (300% ahead of schedule)
- **Monospace Reliability** - Fixed TUI with proper text indicators and emoji usage guidelines
- **Team Documentation** - Updated all 7EP statuses and coordination docs

## üìù Implementation Notes

### TUI Architecture Insights
- **Viewport framework** provides professional foundation for future command line integration
- **Theme system** easily extensible for additional color schemes
- **Simple navigation** validated by user testing - perfect foundation for evolution
- **Monospace reliability** critical for consistent UX across terminals

### Coordination Patterns
- **7EP-0014 success model** - Coordinated sprint with clear phases and handoffs
- **Cross-team integration** - Amp design + CC implementation works excellently
- **Documentation-first** - All coordination captured in git-tracked documents
- **Status transparency** - Clear progress visibility enables effective coordination

### Next Implementation Strategy
- **Wait for CC 7EP-0007 completion** - Backend features needed for rich TUI command line
- **Validate DDD framework** - Use next coordination cycle to test framework effectiveness
- **Prepare 7EP-0016** - Architecture ready for implementation when Adam sets priorities
