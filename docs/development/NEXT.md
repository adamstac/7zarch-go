# What's Next for Everyone

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-14 16:30  
**Project Phase:** DDD Framework Implementation + Strategic Direction Planning  
**Sprint Status:** 7EP-0017 operational activation in progress, awaiting Adam's next major focus decision

## 🔄 Current Active Work
**CC:** DDD Framework Implementation (operational docs) + CodeRabbit feedback resolution  
**Amp:** DDD Framework validation + strategic planning coordination  
**AC:** Ready for strategic assignment, supporting framework validation  
**Adam:** Strategic priority decision needed (next major focus area after framework complete)

## 📋 Next Priorities (Sequential)
1. **Complete DDD Framework Implementation** → CC finishes operational document creation and boot-up integration
2. **Validate Framework Effectiveness** → Test coordination patterns with current project usage
3. **🎯 Adam Strategic Direction Decision** → TUI evolution vs TrueNAS integration vs optimization focus
4. **Major Feature Sprint Kickoff** → Begin implementation of chosen strategic direction
5. **Technical Debt Resolution** → Address CodeRabbit feedback on test infrastructure

## 🔗 Active Coordination Points
- **CC → Team:** DDD operational framework completion (docs/development/ structure implementation)
- **Team → Framework:** Real usage validation of coordination patterns and effectiveness
- **Adam → Team:** Strategic priority decision for next major focus area
- **Framework Testing:** Using current coordination (CC technical debt, team assignments) to validate DDD patterns

## 🚫 Blocked/Waiting
- **Major feature work:** Waiting for Adam's strategic direction decision AND framework completion
- **7EP-0016 TUI evolution:** Ready when frontend prioritized + framework operational
- **TrueNAS integration:** Ready when backend/cloud prioritized + framework operational
- **Performance optimization:** Ready when polish/stability prioritized + framework operational

## ⚡ Immediate Actions (This Session)
- [ ] CC: Complete NEXT.md as primary coordination hub (this document)
- [ ] CC: Integrate operational priorities into /CLAUDE.md boot-up checklist (step 2.5)
- [ ] CC: Address CodeRabbit technical debt (test infrastructure, performance thresholds)
- [ ] Team: Validate framework by using it for current coordination needs
