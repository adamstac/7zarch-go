# Strategic Decision Framework

**Purpose**: Strategic assessment tools and decision matrices for 7zarch-go project leadership  
**Audience**: Adam (primary), Amp-s (strategic support), team coordination  
**Framework**: Document Driven Development (7EP-0017, 7EP-0019)

## ðŸ“Š Decision Framework

### Impact Assessment Matrix
| Option | User Impact | Technical Complexity | Resource Requirement | Strategic Value |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| 7EP-0010 TUI | High - Better UX | Medium - Well planned | 1-2 weeks AC | Product evolution |
| TrueNAS Integration | High - Enterprise use | High - External API | 3-4 weeks CC | Market expansion |
| Performance Optimization | Medium - Power users | High - Deep optimization | 2-3 weeks CC | Technical excellence |
| 7EP-0018 Blog | Low - Internal | Low - Static generator | 1 week CC | Framework showcase |

### Resource Allocation Framework
- **CC (Claude Code)**: Backend, infrastructure, performance, integrations
- **AC (Augment Code)**: Frontend, user experience, TUI, quality assurance  
- **Amp**: Strategic oversight, architecture review, coordination
- **Available Capacity**: Both CC and AC ready for immediate assignment

### Timeline Considerations
- **Q4 2025**: Product maturity and market readiness
- **Foundation Complete**: Can now focus on advanced features without infrastructure concerns
- **Team Velocity**: Proven high-quality delivery with DDD framework

## ðŸš€ Recommended Actions Templates

### Option 1: Focus on User Experience (TUI)
```bash
# Assign AC to 7EP-0010 TUI implementation
echo "Strategic Decision: User experience evolution via TUI" >> docs/development/NEXT.md
echo "Assignment: AC to implement 7EP-0010 TUI system" >> docs/development/NEXT.md
echo "Timeline: 2-3 week implementation, ready for Christmas 2025" >> docs/development/NEXT.md
```

### Option 2: Focus on Market Expansion (TrueNAS)
```bash
# Assign CC to TrueNAS integration research and implementation
echo "Strategic Decision: Enterprise market expansion via TrueNAS" >> docs/development/NEXT.md
echo "Assignment: CC to research and implement TrueNAS integration" >> docs/development/NEXT.md
echo "Timeline: Investigation phase (1 week) + implementation (3-4 weeks)" >> docs/development/NEXT.md
```

### Option 3: Focus on Technical Excellence (Performance)
```bash
# Assign CC to performance optimization work
echo "Strategic Decision: Technical excellence through performance optimization" >> docs/development/NEXT.md
echo "Assignment: CC to optimize search performance 10x and memory usage" >> docs/development/NEXT.md
echo "Timeline: Performance analysis (1 week) + optimization (2-3 weeks)" >> docs/development/NEXT.md
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics Framework

### Team Coordination
- **Decision Velocity**: How quickly strategic decisions get made and communicated
- **Execution Quality**: Delivered features meet or exceed specifications  
- **Framework Effectiveness**: DDD coordination reduces communication overhead

### Product Progress
- **User Value**: Features directly improve user experience and workflows
- **Market Position**: Product capabilities advance competitive position
- **Technical Foundation**: Infrastructure supports long-term product evolution

### Strategic Alignment
- **Vision Coherence**: All work advances the "7-Zip with a brain" vision
- **Resource Efficiency**: Team capacity utilized effectively without burnout
- **Growth Trajectory**: Product evolves toward sustainable market success

## ðŸ”„ Decision Implementation Protocol

### When Making Strategic Decisions
1. **Use Impact Assessment Matrix** - Evaluate options systematically
2. **Update NEXT.md** with the decision and rationale
3. **Assign specific agent** with clear scope and timeline using templates above
4. **Update agent role document** with new priority
5. **Set checkpoint reviews** for progress and course correction

### Decision Communication
- **NEXT.md**: Primary coordination document for cross-team decisions
- **Role documents**: Agent-specific assignments and current focus
- **7EP documents**: Detailed feature specifications and progress tracking
- **Session logs**: Real-time work documentation and handoffs

---

**Framework Integration**: This strategic framework integrates with the DDD operational framework to provide systematic decision-making tools while maintaining clear separation between strategic assessment and daily operational coordination.

**Usage Pattern**: Adam uses this framework for strategic decisions â†’ Updates NEXT.md with decisions â†’ Agents implement via role-specific coordination patterns
