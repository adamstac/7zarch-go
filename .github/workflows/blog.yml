# 7zarch Blog Deployment
# 
# DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY: Draft/Published Directory Structure
# - blog/drafts/     → Safe to edit, never deployed
# - blog/published/  → Auto-deploys to production  
# - Manual trigger   → Always available as override

# PUBLISHING WORKFLOW:
#
# 1. Write drafts safely:
#    vim blog/drafts/my-new-post.md
#    git add blog/drafts/my-new-post.md 
#    git commit -m "draft: exploring new ideas"
#    git push  # ← No deployment triggered
#
# 2. Publish when ready:
#    git mv blog/drafts/my-new-post.md blog/published/003-my-new-post.md
#    git commit -m "publish: my new post" 
#    git push  # ← Deployment triggered automatically
#
# 3. Manual deployment (if needed):
#    GitHub → Actions → Deploy Blog → Run workflow → Enter reason
#
# BENEFITS:
# ✅ Safe to iterate on drafts in main branch
# ✅ Intentional publishing via file move
# ✅ Clear publication intent in git history  
# ✅ No accidental deployments
# ✅ Manual override always available
