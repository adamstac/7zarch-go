## üöÄ Quick Start Checklist

When starting a new Amp session:

1. **Check git status**
   ```bash
   git status
   git pull
   git branch
   ```

2. **Review current state**
   ```bash
   # Read the roadmap
   cat docs/development/pr-merge-roadmap.md | head -50

   # Check for active PRs
   gh pr list

   # See recent commits
   git log --oneline -10
   ```

3. **Understand today's priorities**
   - Check `/docs/development/tomorrow-plan.md` if it exists
   - Look for any session summaries from previous work

4. **Test the build**
   ```bash
   make dev            # Build with Goreleaser and install
   ~/bin/7zarch-go list --dashboard  # Test display modes
   ```

## üí° Project Patterns & Preferences

### Code Style
- **NO COMMENTS** unless explicitly requested
- Keep responses concise (4 lines max unless asked for detail)
- Prefer simplicity over complexity
- Use existing code patterns from the codebase

### Display System Pattern
```go
// All display modes implement this interface
type Display interface {
    Render(archives []*storage.Archive, opts Options) error
    Name() string
    MinWidth() int
}
```

### Status Icons
- ‚úì = Present/OK
- ? = Missing
- X = Deleted
- Text alternatives: OK, MISS, DEL

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches: `feat/7ep-XXXX-description`
- **Always create feature branches for new work** - Never work directly on main
- **Branch from main** for all new features, not from other feature branches  
- **Keep branches focused** - One branch per 7EP or major feature
- **Clean working directory** before starting new feature work
- **GPG SIGNING REQUIRED**: All commits to the remote repo must be GPG signed
- **NO SIGNATURES**: Don't add "ü§ñ Generated" or "Co-Authored-By" to commits
- Comprehensive commit messages with what and why
- Squash merge PRs with branch deletion

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Commands

### Build & Test
```bash
# Professional build system (Level 2 reproducible) - JUST IMPLEMENTED!
make dev            # Build and install to ~/bin
make dist           # Build for current platform  
make validate       # Validate Goreleaser config
make release        # Create release (CI only)

# Legacy build system (still available)
make build          # Build binary
make test           # Run tests
make lint           # Run linter
```

gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."

# Merge PR
gh pr merge [number] --squash --delete-branch

# Check PR status
gh pr list
gh pr view [number]
```
