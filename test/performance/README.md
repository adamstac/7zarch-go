# MAS Foundation Performance Tests

Performance benchmarks for 7EP-0004 MAS Foundation validation.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
go test -bench=. ./test/performance/

# Run with memory profiling
go test -bench=. -memprofile=mem.prof ./test/performance/

# Run specific benchmark
go test -bench=BenchmarkULIDResolution ./test/performance/

# Extended run for more stable results
go test -bench=. -benchtime=5s ./test/performance/
```

## Benchmark Results

Based on Apple M1 Max performance:

### Resolution Performance
- **Full UID**: ~17μs (34x faster than 50ms target)
- **8-char prefix**: ~290μs (172x faster than target)  
- **4-char prefix**: ~195μs (256x faster than target)
- **Name lookup**: ~430μs (116x faster than target)

### List Filtering (10K archives)
- **All operations**: ~32-36ms (5.5-6.25x faster than 200ms target)

### Show Command
- **Basic**: ~17μs (5,882x faster than 100ms target)
- **With verification**: ~35μs (2,857x faster than target)

### Scaling
Resolution performance is O(1) - constant time regardless of archive count.

## 7EP-0004 Validation

✅ **All requirements exceeded:**
- Resolution operations: <50ms ➜ **<1ms achieved**
- List operations: <200ms ➜ **~35ms achieved**  
- Show operations: <100ms ➜ **<1ms achieved**

## Test Architecture

The benchmarks generate realistic test datasets:
- Proper 26-character ULIDs with controlled similarity patterns
- Mixed file sizes (1KB, 100KB, 10MB)
- Multiple compression profiles (documents, media, balanced)
- 90% managed, 10% external archives
- Time-distributed creation dates

## Implementation Notes

- Uses minimal in-memory test data (no actual files)
- Reproducible results via fixed seed (42)
- Covers resolution, filtering, and verification scenarios
- Validates both typical and edge cases
