## üöÄ Quick Start Checklist

When starting a new session:

1. **Check git status**
   ```bash
   git status
   git pull
   git branch
   ```

2. **Review current state**
   ```bash
   # Read the roadmap
   cat docs/development/pr-merge-roadmap.md | head -50

   # Check for active PRs
   gh pr list

   # See recent commits
   git log --oneline -10
   ```

2.5. **CHECK OPERATIONAL PRIORITIES** (DDD Framework)
   ```bash
   # Personal current assignments and coordination
   cat docs/development/CLAUDE.md | head -20
   
   # Shared team priorities and blockers  
   cat docs/development/NEXT.md | head -30
   
   # Active 7EP coordination context
   grep -l "Status.*ACTIVE\|In Progress" docs/7eps/*.md | xargs ls -la
   ```

3. **Understand today's priorities**
   - Check `/docs/development/NEXT.md` for shared team coordination
   - Review `/docs/development/CLAUDE.md` for personal assignments
   - Look for any session summaries from previous work

4. **Test the build**
   ```bash
   make dev            # Build with Goreleaser and install
   ~/bin/7zarch-go list --dashboard  # Test display modes
   ```

## üí° Project Patterns & Preferences

### Code Style
- **NO COMMENTS** unless explicitly requested
- Keep responses concise (4 lines max unless asked for detail)
- Prefer simplicity over complexity
- Use existing code patterns from the codebase

### Display System Pattern
```go
// All display modes implement this interface
type Display interface {
    Render(archives []*storage.Archive, opts Options) error
    Name() string
    MinWidth() int
}
```

### Status Icons
- ‚úì = Present/OK
- ? = Missing
- X = Deleted
- Text alternatives: OK, MISS, DEL

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches: `feat/7ep-XXXX-description`
- **Always create feature branches for new work** - Never work directly on main
- **Branch from main** for all new features, not from other feature branches  
- **Keep branches focused** - One branch per 7EP or major feature
- **Clean working directory** before starting new feature work
- Squash merge PRs with branch deletion
- **GPG SIGNING REQUIRED**: All commits to the remote repo must be GPG signed. Any unsigned commits must be squashed with a GPG signed commit before pushing
- **NO SIGNATURES**: Don't add "ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By" to commits
- No Claude mentions in commits (Adam will say "no claude mention" if needed)
- Comprehensive commit messages with what and why

## üîÑ Session Handoff Protocol

### At Session End
1. Commit any work in progress
2. Update this file with important context
3. Update `/docs/development/pr-merge-roadmap.md` if PRs changed
4. Leave clear TODO comments in code if partially complete
5. Push all changes to appropriate branches

### At Session Start
1. Read this file first
2. Check for any new commits or PRs
3. Look for session summaries or handoff notes
4. Verify build still works
5. Continue from documented priorities

## üö® Emergency Contacts

- **Build broken?** Check recent merges, try `git bisect`
- **PR conflicts?** Pull main, rebase feature branch
- **Dependabot spam?** Can be batched or ignored temporarily
- **AC/CC coordination?** Use PR descriptions and `/docs/development/`

## üìù Notes Section

### Recent Decisions
- Display modes use no-right-border pattern for cleaner alignment
- Card mode uses "‚úì OK" format (icon + text)
- TUI will wrap existing displays, not rebuild them
- Charmbracelet tools (Bubble Tea) chosen for TUI
- **7EP-0007 Phase 2 Complete**: Search engine with exceptional ~60-100¬µs performance
- Search architecture: Inverted index + LRU cache + thread-safe design
- All searchable fields indexed: name, path, profile, metadata

### Gotchas
- Show command requires 12-char ULID minimum (not 8!)
- Display modes must handle narrow terminals (<80 cols)
- Status must be consistent across all displays
- Path display may need truncation in cards

### Session-Specific Context
<!-- Update this section with temporary context that might not persist -->
- 2025-08-13: **DUAL AMP ROLES CREATED** üéØ - Clear strategic vs technical separation
- **AMP-S (Strategic)**: Product strategy, business impact, executive leadership, roadmap planning  
- **AMP-T (Technical)**: Code quality, architecture review, technical standards, implementation oversight
- **ACTIVATION**: See `AMP.md` for complete role documentation and activation examples
- **PURPOSE**: Clear role separation - strategic vision (Amp-s) + technical execution (Amp-t)
- 2025-08-14: **7EP-0007 FULLY COMPLETE** ‚úÖ - All 3 phases merged to main
- **PHASE 2**: ‚úÖ MERGED - Search engine (~60-100¬µs performance, 5000x faster than target)
- **PHASE 3**: ‚úÖ MERGED - Batch operations with enterprise-grade concurrency and safety
- **FEATURES DELIVERED**: Complete Query ‚Üí Search ‚Üí Batch workflow operational
- **PR STATUS**: PR #27 & #28 both merged with dual leadership approval
- **TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENT**: 4,338 total lines added across all phases
- **TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE**: Basic archive manager ‚Üí Enterprise power user command center
- **PRODUCTION READY**: Full workflow from discovery to bulk operations
- **STRATEGIC IMPACT**: Complete enterprise archive management solution in production
