  - Status: Ready for implementation
  - Goal: Interactive archive management with Bubble Tea
  - Reference: `/docs/7eps/7ep-0010-interactive-tui-application.md`
  - Builds on: Your display system patterns

### Recent Handoff üîÑ
- **PR #19 Handoff to CC** - You handed off linting/CI work to CC per 7EP-0012
- You are NO LONGER working on PR #19 (`docs/7ep-0011-lint-tightening` branch)
- CC now owns PR #19 completion

### Other Active Work
- **7EP-0013 Build Pipeline** - CC implementing Goreleaser (blocks all development)
- **PR #9** - List filters/refinements (your work, may need review)
- **PR #10** - Trash management ready to merge (your work)

## üí° Project Patterns & Preferences

### Code Style
- **NO COMMENTS** unless explicitly requested
- Keep responses concise (4 lines max unless asked for detail)
- Prefer simplicity over complexity
- Use existing code patterns from the codebase

### Your Display System Pattern (Reference for TUI)
```go
// All display modes implement this interface
type Display interface {
    Render(archives []*storage.Archive, opts Options) error
    Name() string
    MinWidth() int
}
```

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches: `feat/7ep-XXXX-description`
- **Always create feature branches for new work** - Never work directly on main
- **Branch from main** for all new features, not from other feature branches
- **Keep branches focused** - One branch per 7EP or major feature  
- **Clean working directory** before starting new feature work
- **GPG SIGNING REQUIRED**: All commits to the remote repo must be GPG signed. Any unsigned commits must be squashed with a GPG signed commit before pushing
- **NO SIGNATURES**: Don't add "ü§ñ Generated" or "Co-Authored-By" to commits
- Comprehensive commit messages with what and why
- Squash merge PRs with branch deletion

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Commands

### Build & Test
```bash
# Goreleaser build system (Level 2 reproducible) - CC just implemented!
make dev            # Build and install to ~/bin
make dist           # Build for current platform  
make validate       # Validate Goreleaser config

# Legacy build system (still available)
make build          # Build binary
make test           # Run tests
```

### Your Display Modes (Reference)
```bash
./7zarch-go list --table      # Your enhanced table mode
./7zarch-go list --compact    # Your compact mode
./7zarch-go list --card       # Your card mode
./7zarch-go list --tree       # Your tree mode
./7zarch-go list --dashboard  # Your dashboard mode
```

### TUI Development
```bash
# Test your TUI implementation
./7zarch-go tui              # Your new TUI command
go run . tui                 # During development
```

## üéØ TUI Implementation Guide

### Your Current Task: 7EP-0010
**Reference**: Read `/docs/7eps/7ep-0010-interactive-tui-application.md` for full specification

**Key Points**:
- Use Charmbracelet Bubble Tea framework
- Wrap your existing display modes (don't rebuild them)
- Interactive navigation, search, and operations
- Perfect for overnight focused development session

**Success Criteria**:
- Interactive archive browsing
- Keyboard navigation
- Real-time filtering
- Archive operations (show, move, delete)

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Basic TUI with list view using existing display modes
2. **Phase 2**: Add interactive navigation and keyboard shortcuts
3. **Phase 3**: Integrate archive operations (show, move, delete)
4. **Phase 4**: Real-time search and filtering

## üîÑ Coordination with CC

### Current Coordination
- **CC handling**: PR #19 (linting/CI infrastructure) 
- **You handling**: TUI implementation (user-facing features)
- **No overlap**: Clean separation per 7EP-0012 handoff protocol

### Communication
- Use PR descriptions for major updates
- Reference 7EP numbers in commits
- Update `/docs/development/` for coordination needs

## üöÄ Quick Start Checklist

When starting a TUI session:

1. **Confirm current branch**
   ```bash
   git status          # Should be on main or new TUI branch
   git pull            # Get latest changes
   ```

2. **Test existing display system**
   ```bash
   ./7zarch-go list --dashboard  # Verify your display modes work
   ```

3. **Review TUI specification**
   ```bash
   cat docs/7eps/7ep-0010-interactive-tui-application.md
   ```

4. **Start TUI implementation**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/7ep-0010-tui  # Create TUI branch
   ```

## üìù Success Patterns

### What's Working Well
- **Your display system**: 5 modes shipping successfully
- **MAS Foundation**: Your ULID resolution and commands are solid
- **User-first approach**: Your features solve real user problems
- **Charmbracelet choice**: Reduces TUI implementation complexity

### Your Strengths to Leverage
- **User workflow understanding**: You built the commands users actually need
- **Display system mastery**: You know how to present archive data beautifully
- **CLI UX intuition**: Your commands feel natural and discoverable

## üí° TUI Development Tips

### Leverage Your Existing Work
- **Reuse display modes**: Don't rebuild table/card/tree views
- **Reuse filtering logic**: Your list filters work perfectly in TUI
- **Reuse commands**: show/move/delete commands integrate directly

### Bubble Tea Patterns
- **Model-View-Update**: Standard Bubble Tea architecture
- **Component composition**: Build complex UI from simple components
- **State management**: Clean separation of UI state and data

## üîÑ Session Handoff Protocol

### At Session End
1. Commit TUI work in progress to feature branch
2. Update this file with TUI implementation status
3. Document any blockers or decisions for next session
4. Push branch for CC coordination if needed

### Session-Specific Context
<!-- Update this section with current TUI work status -->
- 2025-08-13: Just started TUI work after PR #19 handoff to CC
- **TUI Goal**: Interactive demo by end of session
- **Implementation Status**: [Update as you progress]

---

**Remember**: You're AC (Augment Code). You build user-facing features that delight. You understand workflows. You make CLIs feel intuitive. The TUI is your chance to showcase interactive archive management at its best! üéØ
